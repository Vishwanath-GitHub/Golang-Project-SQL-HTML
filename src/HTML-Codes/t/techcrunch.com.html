PlayStation or Microsoft with Xbox, but the iPhone-maker continues to uniformly drive the industry with decisions made in the Apple App Store.<\/p>\n<p>The company made the news a couple times late this week for App Store approvals. Once for denying a gaming app, and the other for approving one.<\/p>\n<p>The denial was <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/xcloud\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"xcloud\">xCloud <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> gaming app, something the Xbox folks weren&#8217;t too psyched about. Microsoft xCloud is one of the Xbox&#8217;s most substantial software platform plays in quite some time, allowing gamers to live-stream titles from the cloud and play console-quality games across a number of devices. It&#8217;s a huge effort that&#8217;s been in preview for a bit, but is likely going to officially launch next month. The app had been in a Testflight preview for iOS, but as Microsoft looked to push it to primetime, Apple said not so fast.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The app that was approved was the Facebook Gaming app which Facebook has been trying to shove through the App Store for months to no avail. It was at last approved Friday after the company stripped one of its two central features, a library of playable mobile games. In a curt statement to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/08\/07\/technology\/facebook-apple-gaming-app-store.html\">The New York Times<\/a>, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said, \u201cUnfortunately, we had to remove gameplay functionality entirely in order to get Apple\u2019s approval on the stand-alone Facebook Gaming app.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox team also took the unusually aggressive step of calling out Apple in a statement that reads, in-part, &#8220;Apple stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass. And it consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft is still a $1.61 trillion company so don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m busting out the violin for them, but iOS is the world&#8217;s largest gaming platform, something CEO Tim Cook proudly proclaimed when the company launched its own game subscription platform, Apple Arcade, last year. Apple likes to play at its own pace, and all of these game-streaming platforms popping up at the same time seem poised to overwhelm them.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2018464\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2018464\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2018464\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"750\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg 1349w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/xcloud.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2018464\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Microsoft<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are a few things about cloud gaming apps that seem at odds with some of the App Store&#8217;s rules, yet these rules are, of course, just guidelines written by Apple.\u00a0 For Apple&#8217;s part, they basically said (full statement later) that the App Store had curators for a reason and that approving apps like these means they can&#8217;t individually review the apps which compromises the App Store experience.<\/p>\n<p>To say that&#8217;s &#8220;the reason&#8221; seems disingenuous because the company has long approved platforms to operate on the App Store without stamping approval on the individual pieces of content that can be accessed. With &#8220;Games&#8221; representing the App Store&#8217;s most popular category, Apple likely cares much more about keeping their own money straight.<\/p>\n<p>Analysis from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/01\/07\/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html\">CNBC<\/a> pinned Apple&#8217;s 2019 App Store total revenue at $50 billion.<\/p>\n<p>When these cloud gaming platforms like xCloud scale with zero iOS support, millions of Apple customers, myself included, are actually going to be pissed that their iPhone can&#8217;t do something that their friend&#8217;s phone can. Playing console-class titles on the iPhone would be a substantial feature upgrade for consumers. There are about 90 million Xbox Live users out there, a substantial number of which are iPhone owners I would imagine. The games industry is steadily rallying around game subscription networks and cloud gaming as a move to encourage consumers to sample more titles and discover more indie hits.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen enough of these sagas to realize that sometimes parties will kick off these fights purely as a tactic to get their way in negotiations and avoid workarounds, but it&#8217;s a tactic that really only works when consumers have a reason to care. Most of the bigger App Store developer spats have played in the background and come to light later, but at this point the Xbox team undoubtedly sees that Apple isn&#8217;t positioned all that well to wage an App Store war in the midst of increased antitrust attention over a cause that seems wholly focused on maintaining their edge in monetizing the games consumers play on Apple screens.<\/p>\n<p>CEO Tim Cook spent an awful lot of time in his Congressional Zoom room answering question about perceived anticompetitiveness on the company&#8217;s application storefront.<\/p>\n<p>The big point of tension I could see happening behind closed doors is that plenty of these titles offer in-game transactions and just because that in-app purchase framework is being live-streamed from a cloud computer doesn&#8217;t mean that a user isn&#8217;t still using experiencing that content on an Apple device. I&#8217;m not sure whether this is actually the point of contention, but it seems like it would be a major threat to Apple&#8217;s ecosystem-wide in-app purchase raking.<\/p>\n<p>The App Store does not currently support cloud gaming on Nvidia&#8217;s GeForce platform or Google&#8217;s Stadia which are also both available on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/android\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"android\">Android <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> phones. Both of these platforms are more limited in scope than Microsoft&#8217;s offering which is expected to launch with wider support and pick up wider adoption.<\/p>\n<p>While I can understand Apple&#8217;s desire to not have gaming titles ship that might not function properly on an iPhone because of system constraints, that argument doesn&#8217;t apply so well to the cloud gaming world where apps are translating button presses to the cloud and the cloud is sending them back the next engine-rendered frames of their game. Apple is being forced to get pretty particular about what media types of apps fall under the &#8220;reader&#8221; designation. The inherent interactivity of a cloud gaming platform seems to be the differentiation Apple is pushing here &#8212; as well as the interfaces that allows gamers to directly launch titles with an interface that&#8217;s far more specialized than some generic remote desktop app.<\/p>\n<p>All of these platforms arrive after the company already launched Apple Arcade, a non-cloud gaming product made in the image of what Apple would like to think are the values it fosters in the gaming world: family friendly indie titles with no intrusive ads, no bothersome micro-transactions and Apple&#8217;s watchful review.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s driver&#8217;s seat position in the gaming world has been far from a wholly positive influence for the industry. Apple has acted as a gatekeeper, but the fact is plenty of the &#8220;innovations&#8221; pushed through as a result of App Store policies have been great for Apple but questionable for the development of a gamer-friendly games industry.<\/p>\n<p>Apple facilitated the advent of free-to-play games by pushing in-app purchases which have been abused recklessly over the years as studios have been irresistibly pushed to structure their titles around principles of addiction. Mobile gaming has been one of the more insane areas of Wild West startup growth over the past decade and Apple&#8217;s mechanics for fueling quick transactions inside these titles has moved fast and broken things.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1838033 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg 5120w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Google-GDC-Stadia-14.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Take a look at the 200 top grossing games in the App Store (data via <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/sensor-tower\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"sensor-tower\">Sensor Tower) <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and you&#8217;ll see that all 199 of them rely solely on in-app micro-transaction to reach that status &#8212; Microsoft&#8217;s Minecraft, ranked 50th costs $6.99 to download, though it also offers in-app purchases.<\/p>\n<p>In 2013, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/apple-settles-lawsuit-over-in-app-purchases-by-kids\/#:~:text=17-,Apple%20has%20settled%20a%20lawsuit%20over%20the%20unauthorized%20use%20of,a%20%245%20iTunes%20gift%20card.\">settled<\/a> a class-action lawsuit that kicked off after parents sued Apple for making it too easy for kids to make in-app purchases.

In a statement to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/apple-explains-why-xbox-game-pass-is-not-on-iphone-2020-8\">Business Insider<\/a> responding to the company&#8217;s denial of Microsoft&#8217;s xCloud, Apple laid out its messaging.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">The App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers. Before they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.<\/p>\n<p class=\"sc-77igqf-0 bOfvBY\">Our customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers, and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers, including submitting games individually for review, and appearing in charts and search. In addition to the App Store, developers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The impact has &#8212; quite obviously &#8212; not been uniformly negative, but Apple has played fast and loose with industry changes when they benefit the mothership.

href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/twitter-tiktok-have-held-preliminary-talks-about-possible-combination-11596925449#\">The Wall Street Journal is reporting<\/a> that TikTok and Twitter have held talks about a potential merger, even as the video sharing company defends itself against President Donald Trump&#8217;s pressure to force the sale of the business or potentially ban it.<\/p>\n<p>As the internationally distributed video streaming version of Chinese technology developer Bytedance&#8217;s social media app, TikTok has amassed a global user of avid consumers for its short form videos, including at least 100 million users in the US.<\/p>\n<p>According to The Wall Street Journal, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/twitter\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"twitter\">Twitter <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Bytedance have had preliminary talks about a merger of TikTok&#8217;s US operations with the publicly traded social media company.\u00a0The Journal noted that Microsoft remains the front-runner for TikTok&#8217;s business in the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and that a potential tie-up with Twitter would just be for TikTok&#8217;s North American business.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Any Twitter bid for Bytedance&#8217;s TikTok business would likely have to bolstered by additional investors, since TikTok is valued anywhere between $15 billion and $50 billion dollars &#8212; far too big a bite for Twitter, which has a market capitalization of $29 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Last week, President Trump signed an executive order that would force the sale of TikTok&#8217;s US operations or face being banned. So Bytedance has to find a buyer before Sept. 15, or shut the business down in the US.<\/p>\n<p>So far, Twitter and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> are the only reported bidders for Bytedance&#8217;s business, but others could emerge. And there&#8217;s the potential that any sale could be scuttled by lawsuits challenging the President&#8217;s executive order.<\/p>\n<p>On Saturday, National Public Radio reported that TikTok is planning to do just that. The company will reportedly argue that the executive order from the President didn&#8217;t follow due process, and that its underlying argument that TikTok poses a national security threat is baseless, according to NPR.<\/p>\n<p>Some prominent figures in the technology industry, like Bill Gates, are also questioning the process by which Bytedance is being forced to sell its business.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[Having] Trump kill off the only competitor, it\u2019s pretty bizarre,&#8221; Gates said in an interview with Wired. &#8220;[The] principle that this is proceeding on is singly strange. The cut thing, that&#8217;s doubly strange.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>If Twitter, were, by some miracle, to acquire TikTok&#8217;s US operations, it would add a huge additional pillar to the company&#8217;s business and permanently reshape the social media landscape. It would add a massive new user base and change the demographics of the company&#8217;s user base.<\/p>\n<p>The irony of such a deal shouldn&#8217;t be lost on longtime tech watchers, who will remember that Twitter had the opportunity to become TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/27\/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine\/#:~:text=Twitter%20is%20shutting%20down%20Vine%20Sarah%20Perez%2C%20Katie,shutting%20down%20its%20standalone%20short-form%20video%20app%2C%20Vine.\">if it hadn&#8217;t killed the short form video streaming service, Vine<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"JjDJk2n1kj\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/27\/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine\/\">Twitter is shutting down Vine<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Twitter is shutting down Vine&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/10\/27\/twitter-is-shutting-down-vine\/embed\/#?secret=JjDJk2n1kj\" data-secret=\"JjDJk2n1kj\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"paywall\">\n<p>Mr. Trump\u2019s statements against TikTok have caused concern among potential buyers.

which wants to become Asia&#8217;s largest tech talent pool, raises $900,000 seed round"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cakeresume.com\/en\">CakeResume<\/a> is a startup creating an alternative for the tech industry to job search platforms like LinkedIn. The Taipei-based company, founded in 2016, announced today that it has raised $900,000 in seed funding from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mynavi.jp\/\">Mynavi<\/a>, one of the largest staffing and public relations companies in Japan. The round will be used to expand CakeResume\u2019s operations in other countries, including Japan and India.<\/p>\n<p>Founder and chief executive officer Trantor Liu, who was a full-stack web developer at Codementor before launching <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/cakeresume\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"cakeresume\">CakeResume, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said the startup\u2019s goal is to have the biggest pool of tech talent in Asia. The platform currently has about 500,000 resumes in its database, 75% of which were created by job seekers in Taiwan. More than 3,000 employers, ranging from startups like Appier to large companies like Amazon Web Services, TSMC, Nvidia and Tesla, use it for recruitment.<\/p>\n<p>The other 25% of resumes come from countries including India, Indonesia and the United States. CakeResume plans to expand in Japan with the help of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mynavi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mynavi\">Mynavi, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a strategic investor, and is also seeking partnerships in Southeast and South Asia with recruiters. Liu said CakeResume has a particularly high conversion rate in India, and its goal is to build a pool of at least 100,000 resumes there.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a statement about its decision to invest in CakeResume, a Mynavi representative said, &#8220;The global shortage of IT engineers is becoming more apparent and we are focusing on services related to IT talent in Asia. Among them, CakeResume\u2019s service is excellent in product design, and the service is already used by many talent in the country,&#8221; adding that it expects the platform to become &#8220;the largest IT talent pool in Asia in the near future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In Taiwan, CakeResume\u2019s main rivals are LinkedIn and job search site 104.com.tw. It also competes against other job sites like AngelList, Indeed and Glassdoor.<\/p>\n<p>CakeResume differentiates by giving tech professionals more ways to show off their skills, since many tech companies want more in-depth resumes than the traditional one-pagers used in other fields. The startup was named because its resume builder enables job seekers to add more layers of information, like assembling a cake. For example, CakeResume\u2019s template allows engineers to embed projects from GitHub, while designers can add data visualizations, instead of just including links to them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We aren\u2019t just providing a form to fill in that you can then download as a formatted PDF resume. We want to allow you to be more creative,&#8221; said Liu. &#8220;You can easily embed project images and add descriptions, which makes it easier for HR to understand what you can contribute.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another difference between CakeResume and its competitors is that most people who create a profile are actively seeking new positions, instead of professional networking opportunities. Because it is also tailored for the tech industry, recruiters have a higher chance of getting responses from interested candidates, Liu said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We recently got a review from one of our clients, and they said when they used our platform to contact talent, they got about a 50% reply rate, but on LinkedIn it might be less than 10%,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many job seekers were willing to relocate, but chief operating officer Wei-Cheng Hsieh said CakeResume is now focusing more on helping people find remote jobs. More tech companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/07\/facebook-extends-coronavirus-work-from-home-policy-until-july-2021\">including Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/27\/google-will-continue-to-let-employees-work-from-home-through-the-end-of-june-2021\/\">Google<\/a>, are extending their work from home policies until at least summer 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Though many job postings still specify a location, Liu said CakeResume\u2019s team anticipates this will change as companies continue adapting to the pandemic. While CakeResume will remain focused on matching applicants to jobs instead of networking, it also is also testing some social features to help workers around the world connect with companies and each other.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CakeResume is a startup creating an alternative for the tech industry to job search platforms like LinkedIn.

Its customers include names like AIG, Geico and Progressive, along with smaller players that aren&#8217;t as well known to the American mass market.<\/p>\n<p>The KE IPO will be a big affair because the company is huge and profitable with $3.86 billion in H1 2020 revenue leading to $227.5 million in net income. The Xpeng IPO will be interesting because Tesla&#8217;s strong share price has given float to a great many EV boats. But Duck Creek is a company slowly letting go of perpetual license software sales and scaling its SaaS incomes while still generating nearly half its revenues from services.

What SEO looks like today, Smith says, is all about trying to &#8220;figure out what the algorithm is trying to accomplish and try to accomplish the same thing.&#8221; Google&#8217;s algorithms aren&#8217;t looking for buckets of keywords, they&#8217;re looking to distill a user&#8217;s intent.<\/p>\n<p>The key to building a strategy around SEO as a company breaks down into six steps surrounding intent, says Smith:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Target by intent<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At last month&#8217;s Early Stage virtual event, channel growth experts joined TechCrunch reporters and editors for a series of conversations covering the best tools and strategies for building startups in 2020.

created PypePro, an AI onboarding methodology used by Fortune 500 firms.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Companies have long<\/span> relied on web analytics data like click rates, page views and session lengths to gain customer behavior insights.This method looks at how customers react to what is presented to them, reactions driven by design and copy. But traditional web analytics fail to capture customers\u2019 desires accurately. While marketers are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2020\/02\/10\/predictive-web-analytics-in-marketing\/#782b807310f4\">pushing into predictive analytics<\/a>, what about the way companies foster broader customer experience (CX)?<\/p>\n<p>Leaders <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/smarterwithgartner\/gartner-top-10-data-analytics-trends\/\">are increasingly adopting<\/a> conversational analytics, a new paradigm for CX data. No longer will the emphasis be on how users react to what is presented to them, but rather what \u201cintent\u201d they convey through natural language. Companies able to capture intent data through conversational interfaces can be proactive in customer interactions, deliver hyper-personalized experiences, and position themselves more optimally in the marketplace.<\/p>\n<h2>Direct customer experiences based on customer disposition<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/deloitte.wsj.com\/cio\/2019\/11\/11\/the-business-case-for-conversational-ai\/\">Conversational AI<\/a>, which powers these interfaces and automation systems and feeds data into conversational analytics engines, is a market predicted to grow from $4.2 billion in 2019 to $15.7 billion in 2024. As companies \u201cconversationalize\u201d their brands and open up new interfaces to customers, AI can inform CX decisions not only in how customer journeys are architected&#8211;such as curated buying experiences and paths to purchase&#8211;but also how to evolve overall product and service offerings. This insights edge could become a game-changer and competitive advantage for early adopters.<\/p>\n<p>Today, there is wide variation in the degree of sophistication between conversational solutions from elementary, single-task chatbots to secure, user-centric, scalable AI. To unlock meaningful conversational analytics, companies need to ensure that they have deployed a few critical ingredients beyond the basics of parsing customer intent with natural language understanding (NLU).<\/p>\n<p>While intent data is valuable, companies will up-level their engagements by collecting sentiment and tone data, including via emoji analysis. Such data can enable automation to adapt to a customer\u2019s disposition, so if anger is detected regarding a bill that is overdue, a fast path to resolution can be provided. If a customer expresses joy after a product purchase, AI can respond with an upsell offer and collect more acute and actionable feedback for future customer journeys.<\/p>\n<h2>Tap into a multitude of conversational data points<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today, companies can capture intent data through conversational interfaces for proactive customer interactions and hyper-personalized experiences.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2028385,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"df397101-3774-33de-b81a-35f45fb9085c"},"categories":[424613844,24405894,25515,11160,576737633,576754162,576605952,20429,17396],"tags":[576604165,7344,576639396,40978,576776369,852300,9280],"crunchbase_tag":[576604630],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/GettyImages-1160939955.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2EWFM8p","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":false,"subtitle":"","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.49,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"tableau","cb_name":"Tableau","cb_slug":"tableau-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tableau"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2028378],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2028379"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2028379"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2028379\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2029062,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2028379\/revisions\/2029062"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/evan-kohn"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2028379&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2028385"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2028379"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2028379"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2028379"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2028379"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2028379"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2028379"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2028378,"name":"Evan Kohn","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/evan-kohn\/","description":"A digital marketing and customer experience leader, Evan Kohn is chief business officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pypestream.com\/\">Pypestream<\/a>, where he created PypePro, an AI onboarding methodology used by Fortune 500 firms.","slug":"evan-kohn","links":{"twitter":"evankohn"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"A digital marketing and customer experience leader, Evan Kohn is chief business officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pypestream.com\/\">Pypestream<\/a>, where he created PypePro, an AI onboarding methodology used by Fortune 500 firms.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"evankohn"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program.

and out. But it drives even better than it looks.<\/p>\n<p>This is a driver&#8217;s car.

The power plant in the Polestar 1 is fascinating and delivers power in a way that&#8217;s different from any other electric or hybrid sports car I&#8217;ve driven. It feels like a proper gas-powered grand tourer that can keep up with the best from BMW, Mercedes, and Audi.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll swear there&#8217;s a V8 in the Polestar 1. And that&#8217;s a good thing. Put your foot down, and the car plows forward with the confidence of internal combustion. The power delivery is not digital with an on-or-off feeling familiar in electric vehicles, but rather, it&#8217;s organic and fluid. Hit 45, and the torque seemingly increases, mimicking the soul of a balanced gas engine. The Polestar 1 feels more like a Corvette than a <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tesla-motors\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tesla-motors\">Tesla <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Roadster. And to me, for the first time, I have hope that the future of motoring can be efficient and enjoyable.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The Polestar 1 is a fantastic vehicle full of dumb flaws, but it gets one thing right: The hybrid powertrain in the Polestar 1 is genius. It&#8217;s spectacular and foreshadows a future where cars can change their identities to match a driver&#8217;s tastes better.<\/p>\n<p>[gallery ids=\"2029288,2029294,2029291,2029290,2029289,2029287\"]<\/p>\n<h2>Review<\/h2>\n<p>The Polestar 1 is surprising ways. During my time with the vehicle, I found myself lost in its balanced power. It&#8217;s smooth off the line and confident at speed. The 600 hp power plant is bottomless and yet restrained where needed. This car won&#8217;t beat a Tesla Model S to 60 mph, and to me, that&#8217;s ideal. As I learned from Polestar, the engineers used clever software to restrain the 737 ft-lb of torque and allow the powertrain to deliver the power pleasingly.<\/p>\n<p>But first, some context: Polestar is an off-shoot of Volvo designed to explore the possibilities of electric vehicles. The company&#8217;s first car is the Polestar 1 featured here. The company&#8217;s second vehicle, Polestar 2, is a pure electric sedan that will compete with the Tesla Model 3. The Polestar 2 will be available in the coming months and has an electric range of 275 miles with a starting price of $59,900. The Polestar 1 is a hybrid vehicle and starts at $155,000.<\/p>\n<p>Polestar is following a similar strategy used by Tesla. Like Polestar, Tesla&#8217;s first vehicle was a limited-run sports car, the Roadster. From the Roadster, Tesla expanded its line to more accessible vehicles like the Model S, Model X, and finally, the Model 3. Essentially, Tesla (and now Polestar) built the sexy sports car for attention, and an affordable car people need.<\/p>\n<p>And much like the Tesla Roadster, the Polestar 1 has a bunch of quirky shortcomings. In the Polestar 1, the sun visor only tilts down \u2014 it cannot pull out and twist to the side. The Polestar 1&#8217;s door handles pop-out when the driver approaches the vehicle \u2014 sometimes, other times, they do not, and occasionally, they remained popped out from the car after I closed the door.<\/p>\n<p>I experienced a random assortment of error messages from the Polestar 1. Sometimes, the car would beep to have the passenger buckle their seat belt, even though the passenger seat was empty. Other times, the check engine light flashed. And when one of the tires lost air, the vehicle flashed a warning, but I was unable to see the exact tire pressure to help gauge the urgency of the notice.<\/p>\n<p>One more complaint: The trunk is tiny, and I don&#8217;t think it can hold more than one set of golf clubs.<\/p>\n<p>And even with these shortcomings, the Polestar 1 is fantastic. It feels alive in a way that&#8217;s missing from most hybrid or electric cars. It&#8217;s balanced and controlled and has endless potential.<\/p>\n<p>The Polestar 1 is a tourer. It&#8217;s designed to be comfortable and controlled on endless road trips. Tourers like the Polestar 1 are among my favorite types of cars. Most are broad and sweeping. In the best, the driver feels like a part of the massive machine, working in tandem with engines, motors, and gears, to achieve a common goal. This is often achieved through a competent chassis and potent powertrain, which is the same formula used in the Polestar 1.<\/p>\n<p>The Polestar 1 powers off the start line with the torque pushing the riders into their seats. As speed increases, the torque increases, much like a small-block V8. At speed, the Polestar 1 settles into a grove, seemingly able to maintain any cruising speed. It carves through curves, with balanced steering and capable corning.<\/p>\n<p>The hybrid powertrain comes alive on open stretches of roads. It&#8217;s not rowdy or boisterous, but understated and robust. It&#8217;s not jerky, but sublime. It&#8217;s intoxicating.<\/p>\n<p>Representatives from Polestar explained to me that engineers used several techniques to deliver an enjoyable driving experience. For one, the software is used to restrain the instantaneous torque generally produced by electric motors. Second, the car&#8217;s gearbox utilizes gearing designed for long hauling, not drag racing. Because of this design, the Polestar 1 is slightly slower to 60 mph than some competitors, and yet, it&#8217;s fast enough with a 0-60 time of 4.2 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Like most cars, the Polestar 1 has several different driving modes. In pure electric, the vehicle has a range of 60 miles \u2014 the longest such range of any gas-electric hybrid on the market. In this mode, the Polestar 1 is silent and effortless. In hybrid mode, the power is plentiful but not overflowing. In Power mode, the Polestar 1 transforms into its true self as one of the best grand tourers available.<\/p>\n<p>Car bros often lament about the coming age of the electric vehicle. I understand the pessimism. Electric cars often feel digital, and for most people, driving is an analog experience. Electric motors provide a thrilling experience but often lack a sporty enjoyment. The Polestar 1 achieves both.<\/p>\n<p>Polestar knows the Polestar 1 will not sell in large numbers. With a starting price of $155,000, it&#8217;s selling against the best from Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes. For one, I wouldn&#8217;t get a Polestar 1 over a fully-equipped Porsche 911 or BMW 8 Series. That said, Polestar is only making 1,500 of this initial vehicle.<\/p>\n<p>The Polestar 1 is beautiful and looks like nothing on the road. The hood is long and wide with the back-end stout and robust. The design is clean and straightforward. Hints of Volvo&#8217;s involvement are evident throughout the expansive front-end to the sweeping taillights to the infotainment system.<\/p>\n<p>The future of motoring is electric, but that&#8217;s miles down the road. That&#8217;s okay with me. Cars like the Polestar 1 prove that gas engines still have a place in a world striving to be more energy efficient. Automotive development is evolutionary rather than revolutionary and in the case of the Polestar 1, it&#8217;s a big step in the right direction. The software used to tune the hybrid powertrain foretells a future that&#8217;s as pleasing as what&#8217;s currently available from Europe&#8217;s best.<\/p>\n<p>The Polestar 1 sits in an odd spot. It&#8217;s not a mass market vehicle thanks to it very high price, and it&#8217;s hardly competitive against vehicles in its price range, too. That doesn&#8217;t stop it from standing tall as a fantastic vehicle regardless of its price. It&#8217;s exciting as a technical marvel more so than an obtainable commodity and in the world of motoring, it&#8217;s cars like this that stand the test of time. The Polestar 1 is a future classic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Polestar 1 is stunning inside and out. But it drives even better than it looks.

Nikola is tasked with building and assembling the truck chassis and body.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d said Nikola CEO Mark Russell, in a released statement. \u201cRefuse truck customers have always ordered chassis from truck OEMs and bodies from other suppliers. Nikola has fully integrated the chassis and body, covering both with a single factory warranty. Trucks will include both automated side loaders and front-end loaders \u2014 all of which will be zero-emission.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Industrial markets such as garbage trucks offer electric vehicle makers a large area of opportunity where companies can implement technology with less stringent design requirements. Garbage companies care more about ability than form factor.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the industrial Tre powertrain, Nikola has plans for a consumer pickup named the Nikola Badger. This vehicle is currently available for pre-order and available in two flavors, the battery version with a purported 300 mile range, and the fuel cell version with a range said to be up 600 miles.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Electric truck maker Nikola announced an order for 2,500 garbage trucks, which sent the startup\u2019s stock soaring today.

and welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.<\/p>\n<p>A series of recent and upcoming vehicle reveals have provided yet another reminder of how automakers are doubling down on tech. This isn&#8217;t just about the shift away from knobs and buttons and towards giant touchscreens. I&#8217;m talking about advanced driver assistance systems and more specifically, ADA or active driving assistance. ADA is considered a part of ADAS, but it&#8217;s worth understanding what it is and is not. ADA systems combine steering, acceleration and braking. It&#8217;s technology that actively assists the driver.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot and GM&#8217;s Super Cruise, both of which combine adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assistance, are examples of ADA.<\/p>\n<p>AAA automotive researchers recently conducted tests of these ADA systems. (A photo of a test vehicle colliding with a fake simulated vehicle is below) They found that over the course of 4,000 miles of real-world driving tests, vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems experienced some type of issue every 8 miles, on average. Other problems included disengaging with little notice and &#8220;almost instantly&#8221; handing control back to the driver.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the study, AAA is recommending automakers &#8220;increase the scope of testing for active driving assistance systems and limit their rollout until functionality is improved to provide a more consistent and safer driver experience.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll add my own two cents in here. It&#8217;s not just about ensuring the systems work as intended. It&#8217;s also important that these systems have protections, like driver monitoring systems, so that if control is suddenly handed back to the driver, you can be sure that they will be ready.<\/p>\n<p>Friendly reminder that you can reach out and email me anytime at <a href=\"mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com\">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com<\/a> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips.

Why this matters?<\/p>\n<p>Three months ago, Jump&#8217;s bikes and scooters disappeared from city streets after Uber unloaded the micromobility company to Lime as part of a complex $170 million fundraising round. When the Jump bikes were finally spotted it was in a recycling yard, where more than 20,000 of them laid in piles, awaiting their demise.<\/p>\n<p>New, unused Jump bikes were tucked away in storage. Lime has started to add those Jump bikes to cities like Denver, London, Paris, Seattle and Washington, D.C. But they were only available through the Uber app. Now, the Jump bikes will show up on the Lime app &#8212; as red, not green bike icons. This is the first time since Lime acquired Jump&#8217;s assets that the bikes have been integrated into its app.<\/p>\n<h2>Deal of the week<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png\" alt=\"money the station\" width=\"1600\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The Summer of the SPAC continues with yet another electric automaker turning to a blank check company to go public.<\/p>\n<p>This time it&#8217;s\u00a0Lordstown Motors, the one-year-old Ohio electric automaker that revealed a pickup truck prototype in June. The company said it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/03\/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public\/\">reached a deal to merge<\/a> with special-purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Electric automakers Nikola Motor and Fisker Inc. have also become public companies through a SPAC over the past two months. Shift Technologies, an online used car marketplace and sensor company Velodyne Lidar, also went public via a SPAC, sidestepping the traditional IPO path.<\/p>\n<p>Axios&#8217; Dan Primack predicted recently that more SPACs are coming. He noted that SPACs have raised $24 billion so far in 2020. What company is next?<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>Speaking of publicly traded companies, Chinese electric automaker <strong>Xpeng<\/strong> filed its F-1 on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. An<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1810997\/000119312520212871\/d890887df1.htm\"> F-1 is a required filing<\/a> for foreign companies that want to be listed on an American stock exchange.<\/p>\n<p>To get up to speed, Xpeng recently raised around $500 million in a Series C+ round.\u00a0That announcement followed its Series C round of $400 million closed last November.<\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t read EVERY SINGLE LINE of the F-1 (I promise more of a deep dive next week). But here&#8217;s one highly unusual item. The company has negative gross margins. It brought in revenue, but its cost of sales surpassed revenue. So, negative. This isn&#8217;t including other costs like operating expenses or R&amp;D.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Buckle<\/strong>, a financial services company that insures gig economy workers, including ride-hailing drivers, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buckleup.com\/0804pressrelease\">raised $31 million<\/a> in Series A funding co-led by Eos Venture Partners and HSCM Bermuda.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ChargePoint<\/strong>, the electric vehicle charging network,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/chargepoint-raises-127m-as-electric-vehicle-adoption-grows-among-fleet-operators\/\"> raised $127 million in funding<\/a> in a bid to expand its platform for businesses and fleets in North America and Europe. A mix of existing investors from the oil and gas, utilities and venture industries added to the round, including American Electric Power, Chevron Technology Ventures, Clearvision and Quantum Energy Partners.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grab<\/strong> raised $200 million from South Korean private equity firm Stic, bringing its total funding so far to more than $10 billion at a valuation of about $14.3 billion, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-08-03\/softbank-backed-grab-snags-200-million-from-private-equity-firm?sref=AwwRcx4b\">per Bloomberg<\/a>, which cited unnamed sources. Grab wouldn&#8217;t comment about the raise to TechCrunch.

New volatility of travel \u2014 led by a steep COVID-driven decline, then a less-than-gradual return to a &#8216;new normal,&#8217; and significant mode switching from transit to bikes \u2014 has propelled government transportation agencies to turn to StreetLight, according to Schewel.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve also seen a massive surge in new customers within the thousands of small transportation engineering firms supporting the DOTs, who have been forced by COVID-19 to accelerate their transition to digital data collection (as opposed to going out and doing manual counts or installing devices),&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re of course adjusting where we put our resources to be able to serve these growing segments.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uber<\/strong> acquired <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/uber-picks-up-autocab-to-push-into-places-its-own-app-doesnt-go\/\">U.K.-based Autocab<\/a>, which sells SaaS to the taxi and private hire vehicle industry.<\/p>\n<h2>Notable reads and other tidbits<\/h2>\n<p>Remember when August was the slow news month?

Whether this is a last-ditch effort by a desperate man whose career has been upended by his own poor choices or a viable claim against a double-dealing tech titan will be up to the courts to decide.<\/p>\n<p>This new lawsuit, filed as part of Levandowski&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings, mostly focuses on Uber&#8217;s agreement to indemnify Levandowski against legal action when it bought his self-driving trucking company, Otto Trucking. It also includes new allegations concerning the settlement that Waymo and Uber reached over trade secret theft claims.<\/p>\n<p>The end goal: Levandowski believes and claims in the lawsuit that he should be awarded earn outs associated with the profits of Uber Freight\u00a0 \u2014 the new name of Otto Trucking\u00a0 \u2014 an amount that \u201cshould be at least $4.128 billion.\u201d He also wants Uber to pay the $179 million sum that was awarded to Google in arbitration.<\/p>\n<h3>Connected cars<\/h3>\n<p>The <strong>Black Hat<\/strong> security conference is that annual event that reminds me of how vulnerable connected cars can be. This year, security researchers at the Sky-Go Team, the car hacking unit at Qihoo 360, found more than a dozen vulnerabilities in a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/security-bugs-mercedes-benz-hack\/\">Mercedes-Benz E-Class<\/a> car that allowed them to remotely open its doors and start the engine.<\/p>\n<p>As our cybersecurity editor Zack Whittaker noted,\u00a0vehicle security has gotten better over the past half-decade.

The storefront, called DashMart, is available in eight cities throughout the United States. These are essentially micro-fulfillment centers that carry around 2,000 items. Warehouse employees pick and pack the orders, and then delivery workers, known as Dashers, come to collect the order and deliver to the customer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uber<\/strong> seems to be popping up all over the place in this week&#8217;s newsletter. And delivery is one area I couldn&#8217;t ignore. The company reported its second-quarter earnings and buried in the blizzard of numbers (really this earnings report was a 100-year storm of figures) was a nugget that stood out.<\/p>\n<p>Uber&#8217;s delivery business &#8212; better known as Uber Eats &#8212; is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/ubers-delivery-business-is-now-larger-than-ride-hailing\/\">now bigger than its original<\/a> and core ride-hailing division, based on adjusted net revenue. Now, adjusted net revenue tells only a piece of this evolving Uber story. Income, or losses in the case of Uber&#8217;s delivery business, are also important.<\/p>\n<p>Still, looking at the change of the past year, and specifically in the past two quarters, it&#8217;s clear that Uber&#8217;s strategy has shifted. Here are some Q2 numbers to chew one.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivery gross bookings: $6.96 billion<\/li>\n<li>Mobility gross bookings: $3.05 billion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how those gross bookings results turned into adjusted net revenue:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivery adjusted net revenue: $885 million<\/li>\n<li>Mobility adjusted net revenue: $793 million<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And how those revenue results turned into adjusted profit, and adjusted losses:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Delivery adjusted EBITDA: -$232 million<\/li>\n<li>Mobility adjusted EBITDA: $50 million<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi provided the upshot during the Q2 earnings call. &#8220;It&#8217;s become clear that we have a hugely valuable hedge across our two core businesses that is a critical advantage in any recovery scenario. When travel restrictions lift we know the mobility trips rebound. If restrictions continue or need to be re-imposed our delivery business will compensate.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Ride-hailing<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1926823 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"401\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png 1600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/the-station-ride-hailing1.png?resize=50,13 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Uber<\/strong> and Lyft are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/05\/uber-and-lyft-face-new-lawsuit-from-ca-labor-commissioner\/\">facing separate lawsuits<\/a> from the office of the California Labor Commissioner alleging wage theft.

The Lyriq will go into production in the U.S. in late 2022, more than two years after its reveal date. The Cadillac Lyriq will be a global product, meaning it will be headed to China as well.

The cornerstone of GM&#8217;s electric strategy isn&#8217;t a specific electric car or truck.

Stoll argues that the company&#8217;s lofty ambition to &#8220;lap Tesla&#8221; might require extraordinary measures. &#8220;Sometimes, the answer is to take back control,&#8221; he writes.

Its customers include names like AIG, Geico and Progressive, along with smaller players that aren&#8217;t as well known to the American mass market.<\/p>\n<p>The KE IPO will be a big affair because the company is huge and profitable with $3.86 billion in H1 2020 revenue leading to $227.5 million in net income. The Xpeng IPO will be interesting because Tesla&#8217;s strong share price has given float to a great many EV boats.

Prior to this funding round, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mux-2\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mux-2\">Mux <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> most recently raised a roughly $20 million round in mid-2019. In total, the company had raised a hair under $32 million before its Series C, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/pitchbook.com\">PitchBook data<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The Mux round lands amidst a number of trends that we&#8217;re tracking here at TechCrunch, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/22\/api-startups-are-so-hot-right-now\/\">namely API-based startups<\/a>, which are hot as a group at the moment, and startups that are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/15\/as-companies-accelerate-their-digital-transitions-employees-detail-a-changed-workplace\/\">serving an accelerating digital transformation<\/a>.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore a bit of Mux&#8217;s history, and then dig into how the startup&#8217;s current pace of revenue growth explains its fresh infusion of capital.<\/p>\n<h2>From exits to analytics to APIs<\/h2>\n<p>TechCrunch spoke with Mux&#8217;s founder <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/zencoder\/\">Jon Dahl<\/a> about the round, curious about how the company came to be. Dahl was a co-founder of Zencoder back in the early 2010s, which sold to Brightcove. When Zencoder launched, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/05\/05\/yc-funded-zencoder-wants-to-be-the-amazon-web-services-of-video-encoding\/\">TechCrunch said that it wanted<\/a> &#8220;to be the Amazon Web Services of video encoding.&#8221; It wound up <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2012\/07\/26\/brightcove-zencoder-transition-to-freemium\/\">selling for $30 million<\/a>, a figure that stood a bit taller in 2012, when the transaction was announced.<\/p>\n<p>Dahl stuck around Brightcove for a few years while angel investing. Then in late 2015 he founded Mux. The new startup first built an analytics tool called <a href=\"https:\/\/mux.com\/data\">Mux Data<\/a>. Dahl said the analytics product was needed because more conventional tooling like Google Analytics don&#8217;t work well with online video.<\/p>\n<p>Mux Data is a SaaS product. But what made Mux even more interesting is its on-demand infra play, namely <a href=\"https:\/\/mux.com\/\">Mux Video<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Mux Video is delivered via an API, supporting both live and on-demand video for other companies. The startup likes to argue that it&#8217;s doing for video what Stripe has done for payments, namely take a bundle of complexity and headache, wrestle it into shape, then offer it via a developer-friendly hook.<\/p>\n<p>Delivering video, we&#8217;ve seen via <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/15\/cloudinary-passes-60m-arr-without-vc-money\/\">the bootstrapped growth of Cloudinary<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/04\/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service\/\">recent Daily.co round<\/a>, is growing work in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>That fact shows up in Mux&#8217;s numbers, which are somewhat bonkers. The company&#8217;s aggregate revenue numbers are growing at a pace that Dahl described as 4x, while Mux Video&#8217;s revenues are growing at a pace of 8x, he said. Dahl shared a few other metrics &#8212;<em> startups: if you want folks to care about your funding round, follow this example<\/em> &#8212; including that Mux Video&#8217;s LTV\/CAC ratio is somewhere around 5x-6x, and that its net retention is around 160%.<\/p>\n<p>The collected performance data that Mux shared explain why a16z wanted to put its capital into the company.<\/p>\n<p>But to better understand that all the same, I caught up with <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/kshenster\">Kristina Shen<\/a>, a general partner at the venture firm. Shen stressed that Mux was heading in the right direction before the pandemic, but that COVID has accelerated the importance of video in how humans interact with one another &#8212; an accelerating secular shift for Mux to surf, in other words.<\/p>\n<p>COVID has bolstered Mux, with a release regarding its new investment, noting that its &#8220;social media customers [have seen] an increase of 118% in video streaming since mid-February while fitness and health streaming surged by 162%, e-learning grew by 230% and religious streams jumped nearly 3 orders of magnitude.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Shen said during our call that Mux is one of the fastest-growing enterprise SaaS companies that her firm has seen.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, when asked about Mux&#8217;s gross margins, Shen said the company would eventually look similarly to other companies in the infra space, like Twilio and Stripe. This matches what Dahl told this publication, though the founder included a fun wrinkle. Remember Mux Data, the analytics product? Its margins more closely resembles SaaS economics, while Mux Video is more similar to other API, infra plays. So Mux has a bit of SaaS and a bit of infra in it, which should give it a super interesting blended gross margin profile.<\/p>\n<p>Fun. The next time we talk to the firm we&#8217;ll be curious to see how far into the double-digit millions it can stretch its run rate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This morning, Mux, a startup that provides API-based video streaming tooling and analytics, announced that it has closed a $37 million Series C round of capital.

What SEO looks like today, Smith says, is all about trying to &#8220;figure out what the algorithm is trying to accomplish and try to accomplish the same thing.&#8221; Google&#8217;s algorithms aren&#8217;t looking for buckets of keywords, they&#8217;re looking to distill a user&#8217;s intent.<\/p>\n<p>The key to building a strategy around SEO as a company breaks down into six steps surrounding intent, says Smith:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Target by intent<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At last month&#8217;s Early Stage virtual event, channel growth experts joined TechCrunch reporters and editors for a series of conversations covering the best tools and strategies for building startups in 2020.

ByteDance solidified its status as the most valuable startup in private markets. Its success outside China has also become a source of envy and inspiration among its local peers.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the company&#8217;s price tag is under tremendous pressure as it&#8217;s set to shed its priced asset <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> several investors told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/bytedance\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"bytedance\">ByteDance <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> last year generated 120 billion yuan ($17.2 billion) in revenue, said an investor with knowledge of the matter. Around 67% was derived from ads sold on its domestic apps Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version, and popular news aggregator Toutiao. Livestreaming targeted at users of Douyin and another app in the family made up about 17%. Nascent businesses including games, e-commerce and TikTok accounted for 20 billion yuan or roughly another 17%.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The company projected its 2020 revenue at 200 billion yuan ($28.7 billion), with TikTok and other emerging businesses contributing 30 billion yuan or 15%, according to the investor. Previous reports by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-bytedance-results-exclusives\/exclusive-tiktok-owner-bytedances-h1-revenue-better-than-expected-at-over-7-billion-sources-idUSKBN1WF0G7\">Reuters<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-05-27\/bytedance-is-said-to-hit-3-billion-in-profit-as-revenue-doubles?sref=gni836kR\">Bloomberg<\/a> cited similar revenue figures.<\/p>\n<p>Although TikTok continues to account for only a fraction of ByteDance&#8217;s income, the addressable market is enormous. &#8220;It went from having a potential overseas market of 6 billion users to just China, where Douyin and Toutiao are reaching saturation,&#8221; the investor said.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, TikTok has only begun to monetize its enormous user base. The app experienced exponential growth and <a href=\"https:\/\/sensortower.com\/blog\/tiktok-downloads-2-billion\">surpassed 2 billion downloads<\/a> this year as COVID-19 lockdowns kept people indoors, but it&#8217;s unclear how much eyeball time it will retain <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">when social life returns to normal. The app already <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps\/\">lost its largest market India,<\/a> which accounted for about one-third of its user base according to the investor, though app spending in the country is relatively low.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.<\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s left<\/h2>\n<p>Back home, the eight-year-old company faces a crammed market. Tencent-backed Kuaishou claimed that 300 million people used its short video platform daily at the beginning this year, while Douyin said it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/06\/douyin-tiktok-app-in-china-hits-400-million-daily-active-users\/\">reached 400 million DAU<\/a> around the same time. Toutiao is coping with challengers from various fronts, from microblogging veteran Weibo to WeChat&#8217;s in-app news feature.<\/p>\n<p>Like all other tech giants, ByteDance keeps a pipeline of projects alongside its cash cows. It&#8217;s known for its ability to churn out new products, thanks to an organizational structure that divides the firm by functions, primarily technology (development), user growth and monetization, earning it the nickname of an &#8216;app factory.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s more high-profile gestures are in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/03\/19\/tiktok-bytedance-games\/\">mobile games<\/a>, a lucrative internet business where it competes head-on with Tencent; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/tech\/apps-social\/article\/3082033\/tiktok-owner-bytedance-eyes-expansion-online-education-help-ai\">education<\/a>, which could allow it to ride the wave of online education in China; and enterprise software, represented by its <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/bytedance-could-challenge-slack-domestically\/\">work collaboration platform Lark.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So far, none of these new efforts are remotely close to the success of TikTok, Douyin and Toutiao in user acquisition and monetization. It remains to be seen how the poster child for Chinese apps&#8217; globalization strives to hold onto its domination.

Other supposed suitors have been more lukewarm with the typical PR blandishments that their companies \u201cconsider all strategic opportunities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s going on is that TikTok is an extremely valuable property, potentially worth tens of billions of dollars. But it is only worth that value if the company can find a number of deep-pocketed buyers who are willing to bid the price up. If Microsoft is the only suitor, then TikTok\u2019s price may well be shockingly low.<\/p>\n<p>So what do the investment bankers at the heart of the deal do? They run the deal around to every corporate development department in the country, and they leak the information to reporters to try to drum up FOMO in other departments all in the hope that a board member somewhere starts asking, \u201cHey, why aren\u2019t we taking a deep look at this?\u201d Heck, I\u2019m sure even Oracle is taking a look \u2014 they have data centers and \u201csynergy\u201d potential, and its CEO Safra Catz is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/12\/15\/oracle-ceo-safra-catz-joins-trump-transition-team\/\">a major Trump supporter<\/a> as well and could navigate the coming policy shenanigans.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, the reality of the deal is the same: there just aren\u2019t that many companies that can even consider an acquisition. Facebook is out on antitrust, Japan-headquartered Softbank is out on foreign company concerns (the very reason why TikTok is in this position in the first place). Apple isn\u2019t interested, and even companies like Twitter, popular and strategic as they are, don\u2019t have the cash. Twitter is worth less than $30 billion in market cap today \u2014 can they really afford to spend, say, half the company on an acquisition? How much of a writedown would ByteDance have to take to make Twitter a logical fit?<\/p>\n<p>Most of this smoke about interest is designed to push Microsoft to make a fair deal. It\u2019s designed to encourage them to sweeten their offer, lest one of these other \u201csuitors\u201d potentially becomes interested. Yet, the timing of a deal (it needs to be done in a matter of weeks right now) and the scope of the price effectively precludes all but one buyer today.<\/p>\n<p>So, beware bankers talking TikTok. We\u2019re going to get a bunch of names of potential acquirers.

Matt Cooper said 2020 has been a year of rapid growth \u2014 even before the pandemic forced large swaths of the population to stay home and turn to online learning for entertainment and enrichment.<\/p>\n<p>Cooper (who became CEO in 2017) told me that the company decided last year to &#8220;focus on our strength,&#8221; leading to a &#8220;brand relaunch&#8221; in January 2020 to emphasize the richness of its creativity-themed content. At the same time, Cooper said the company defines creativity very broadly, with classes divided into categories like animation, design, illustration, photography, filmmaking and writing.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It\u2019s not <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bob_Ross\">Bob Ross<\/a>,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I love Bob Ross, but that\u2019s a very narrow definition of creativity. Creativity can come in lots of different forms \u2014 art, design, journaling, creative writing, it can be culinary, it can be crafts.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Cooper added that daily usage was already up significantly by mid-March, when the pandemic led to widespread social distancing orders across the United States. That created some challenges, particularly for the more polished <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/skillshare\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"skillshare\">Skillshare <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Originals that the company offers alongside its user-taught classes. (For example, Originals include a color masterclass taught by Victo Ngai, a class on &#8220;discovering your creative voice&#8221; taught by Shantell Martin and a creative nonfiction class by Susan Orlean.)<\/p>\n<p>But of course the pandemic also meant that, as Cooper put it, &#8220;A lot more people had a lot more free time at home and were looking for a constructive way to spend it.&#8221; In fact, the company said that since its rebranding, new membership sign-ups have tripled, with existing members watching three times the number of lessons.<\/p>\n<p>And Skillshare has continued producing Originals by sending instructors &#8220;a huge box of gear&#8221; and then supervising the shoot remotely. In fact, Cooper suggested that this has &#8220;opened up a whole new world&#8221; for the Originals team, allowing them to &#8220;look at parts of the world where we probably weren&#8217;t going to fly a camera crew to go shoot.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7NBggfmdhUY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The company now has 12 million registered members, 8,000 teachers and 30,000 classes \u2014 all accessible for $99 a year or $19 a month.

Previous investors Union Square Ventures, Amasia, Burda Principal Investments and Spero Ventures also participated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSkillshare serves the needs of professional creatives and everyday creative hobbyists alike, which presents a highly-innovative value proposition for the online learning market,&#8221; Pikar said in a statement. &#8220;We look forward to deepening our partnership with Skillshare, and our fellow investors, in order to help Matt Cooper and his team scale up the company\u2019s international reach \u2013 and help Skillshare achieve the full potential of its unique approach to online learning.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Cooper added that the company (which had previously raised $42 million) was cashflow positive for the first half of 2020, so it raised the new round to invest in growth \u2014 particularly in the Skillshare for Teams enterprise product, which allows customers like GM Financial, Vice, AWS, Lululemon, American Crafts and Benefit to offer Skillshare as a perk for their employees.<\/p>\n<p>Cooper is also hoping to expand internationally. Apparently two-thirds of new member sign-ups are coming from outside the United States, with India as Skillshare&#8217;s fastest growing market, and that&#8217;s with &#8220;no local language content, no local language teachers.&#8221; While Cooper plans to remain focused on English content for the near future, he noted that there are other steps Skillshare can take to encourage global viewership, like accepting payments in different currencies and supporting subtitles in different languages.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Just by making it a little easier for those international users to get value from the platform, we expect to see dramatic growth in these international markets,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"A03NBCWqYy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/06\/four-views-how-will-remote-learning-change-the-way-students-learn\/\">Four views: Is edtech changing how we learn?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Four views: Is edtech changing how we learn?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/06\/four-views-how-will-remote-learning-change-the-way-students-learn\/embed\/#?secret=A03NBCWqYy\" data-secret=\"A03NBCWqYy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Skillshare CEO Matt Cooper said 2020 has been a year of rapid growth \u2014 even before the pandemic forced large swaths of the population to stay home and turn to online learning for entertainment and enrichment.

which wants to become Asia&#8217;s largest tech talent pool, raises $900,000 seed round"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cakeresume.com\/en\">CakeResume<\/a> is a startup creating an alternative for the tech industry to job search platforms like LinkedIn. The Taipei-based company, founded in 2016, announced today that it has raised $900,000 in seed funding from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mynavi.jp\/\">Mynavi<\/a>, one of the largest staffing and public relations companies in Japan. The round will be used to expand CakeResume\u2019s operations in other countries, including Japan and India.<\/p>\n<p>Founder and chief executive officer Trantor Liu, who was a full-stack web developer at Codementor before launching <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/cakeresume\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"cakeresume\">CakeResume, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> said the startup\u2019s goal is to have the biggest pool of tech talent in Asia. The platform currently has about 500,000 resumes in its database, 75% of which were created by job seekers in Taiwan. More than 3,000 employers, ranging from startups like Appier to large companies like Amazon Web Services, TSMC, Nvidia and Tesla, use it for recruitment.<\/p>\n<p>The other 25% of resumes come from countries including India, Indonesia and the United States. CakeResume plans to expand in Japan with the help of <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/mynavi\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"mynavi\">Mynavi, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> a strategic investor, and is also seeking partnerships in Southeast and South Asia with recruiters. Liu said CakeResume has a particularly high conversion rate in India, and its goal is to build a pool of at least 100,000 resumes there.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In a statement about its decision to invest in CakeResume, a Mynavi representative said, &#8220;The global shortage of IT engineers is becoming more apparent and we are focusing on services related to IT talent in Asia. Among them, CakeResume\u2019s service is excellent in product design, and the service is already used by many talent in the country,&#8221; adding that it expects the platform to become &#8220;the largest IT talent pool in Asia in the near future.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In Taiwan, CakeResume\u2019s main rivals are LinkedIn and job search site 104.com.tw. It also competes against other job sites like AngelList, Indeed and Glassdoor.<\/p>\n<p>CakeResume differentiates by giving tech professionals more ways to show off their skills, since many tech companies want more in-depth resumes than the traditional one-pagers used in other fields. The startup was named because its resume builder enables job seekers to add more layers of information, like assembling a cake. For example, CakeResume\u2019s template allows engineers to embed projects from GitHub, while designers can add data visualizations, instead of just including links to them.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We aren\u2019t just providing a form to fill in that you can then download as a formatted PDF resume. We want to allow you to be more creative,&#8221; said Liu. &#8220;You can easily embed project images and add descriptions, which makes it easier for HR to understand what you can contribute.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another difference between CakeResume and its competitors is that most people who create a profile are actively seeking new positions, instead of professional networking opportunities. Because it is also tailored for the tech industry, recruiters have a higher chance of getting responses from interested candidates, Liu said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We recently got a review from one of our clients, and they said when they used our platform to contact talent, they got about a 50% reply rate, but on LinkedIn it might be less than 10%,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, many job seekers were willing to relocate, but chief operating officer Wei-Cheng Hsieh said CakeResume is now focusing more on helping people find remote jobs. More tech companies, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/07\/facebook-extends-coronavirus-work-from-home-policy-until-july-2021\">including Facebook<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/27\/google-will-continue-to-let-employees-work-from-home-through-the-end-of-june-2021\/\">Google<\/a>, are extending their work from home policies until at least summer 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Though many job postings still specify a location, Liu said CakeResume\u2019s team anticipates this will change as companies continue adapting to the pandemic. While CakeResume will remain focused on matching applicants to jobs instead of networking, it also is also testing some social features to help workers around the world connect with companies and each other.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>CakeResume is a startup creating an alternative for the tech industry to job search platforms like LinkedIn.

href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/tiktok\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tiktok\">TikTok, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> interest in virtual private networks has spiked.<\/p>\n<p>The use of VPNs can let users access an online service from an encrypted tunnel and thus bypass app blocks. &#8220;We are seeing an increasing number of governments around the world attempting to control the information their citizens can access,&#8221; observes Harold Li, vice president of ExpressVPN, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.expressvpn.com\/press\">claims<\/a> to have over 3,000 servers across 94 countries. &#8220;For this reason, VPNs are used to access blocked sites and services by many worldwide.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, ExpressVPN&#8217;s website saw a 10% week-over-week increase in traffic following the U.S. government&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/31\/trump-ban-tiktok\/\">announcement of a potential TikTok ban<\/a>. The VPN service recorded similar trends in Japan and Australia, where it saw a 19% and 41% WoW increase in traffic respectively after the governments said they might block TikTok.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>When India <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/29\/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps\/\">officially shut down<\/a> TikTok, ExpressVPN saw a 22% WoW jump in web traffic. In Hong Kong, where TikTok <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/06\/tiktok-us-ban-hong-kong-exit\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">voluntarily pulled out<\/a> following the enactment of the national security law, the VPN service logged a 10% WoW traffic growth.<\/p>\n<h2>Not a &#8216;magic bullet&#8217;<\/h2>\n<p>VPNs have long been a popular solution for people to elude restrictions on the internet, be it censored content or app bans. We wrote about Hong Kong residents flocking to VPN services <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/hong-kong-national-security-law-impact-on-tech\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">in anticipation of heightened censorship<\/a>, but the use of a VPN is not a &#8216;magic bullet,&#8217; as a Hong Kong media scholar <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/08\/hong-kong-national-security-law-impact-on-tech\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">warned<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Governments can make it difficult for average users to access VPNs by removing them from local app stores. Users will have to register in another regional app store, which often involves roadblocks like owning a local credit card. Countries can also illegalize the use of VPNs, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/tech\/policy\/article\/2180960\/chinese-vpn-user-fined-accessing-overseas-websites-part-beijings-ongoing\">imposing fines on users<\/a> and even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/china\/policies-politics\/article\/2109618\/man-jailed-selling-vpns-evade-chinas-great-firewall\">imprisoning VPN vendors<\/a> as China did.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on how an app block plays out in practice, there may be other challenges unsolvable by VPNs. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know how potential bans may be enforced yet, and it may require users to jump through other hoops on top of using a VPN, such as removing their local SIM card,&#8221; suggested Li.<\/p>\n<p>Users can look for alternatives to banned apps, but switching services can entail high costs, especially when a product has strong network effects. TikTok, for instance, enjoys a &#8216;content network effect&#8217; that makes it difficult for rivals to match its user experience, as my former colleague Josh Constine <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/01\/content-network-effect\/\">pointed out.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Similarly, those who worry about a<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/06\/trump-signs-executive-orders-banning-transactions-with-tiktok-and-wechat\"> potential WeChat ban in the U.S.<\/a> may simply lack a viable alternative to the Chinese messenger with over 1 billion users. For members of the Chinese diaspora in the U.S., WeChat is the only way for them to reach their families and friends in China, where it&#8217;s the dominant chat app while major Western social networks are unavailable.<\/p>\n<p>Smaller apps are flying under the radar of the authority. Unlike rivals Telegram and Whatsapp, encrypted messenger Signal is still accessible in China &#8212; for now, and the app climbed 51 spots in the China rank of iOS social apps just between August 7-9, currently sitting in the 36th place. Others in China use iMessenger, which also remains unblocked, to stay in touch with their U.S. contacts, but the option is exclusive to iPhone users.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals and businesses worldwide increasingly need to adapt to service shutdowns or risk losing access to the free and open internet. As Telegram founder Pavel Durov <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/durov\/123\">lamented<\/a>: &#8220;[T]he U.S. move against TikTok is setting a dangerous precedent that may eventually kill the internet as a truly global network (or what is left of it).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As countries around the world ban or threaten to restrict TikTok, interest in virtual private networks has spiked.
