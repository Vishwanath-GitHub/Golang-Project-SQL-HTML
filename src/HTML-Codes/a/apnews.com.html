(AP) — Lebanon’s prime minister stepped down from his job on Monday in the wake of the disastrous Beirut port explosion that triggered public fury, saying he has come to the conclusion that corruption in Lebanon is “bigger than the state.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In a brief televised speech after three of his ministers resigned, Prime Minister Hassan Diab said that he is taking “a step back” so he can stand with the people “and fight the battle for change alongside them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I declare today the resignation of this government. May God protect Lebanon,” he said, repeating the last phrase three times.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The move risks opening the way to dragged-out negotiations over a new Cabinet amid urgent calls for reform. It follows a weekend of anti-government protests in the wake of the Aug. 4 explosion in Beirut’s port that decimated the facility and caused widespread destruction, killing at least 160 people and injured about 6,000 others.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The moment typified Lebanon’s political dilemma. Since October, there have been mass demonstrations demanding the departure of the entire sectarian-based leadership over entrenched corruption, incompetence and mismanagement.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the ruling oligarchy has held onto power for so long — since the end of the civil war in 1990 — that it is difficult to find a credible political figure not tainted by connections to them.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Diab blamed corrupt politicians who preceded him for the “earthquake” that has hit Lebanon.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They (political class) should have been ashamed of themselves because their corruption is what has led to this disaster that had been hidden for seven years,” he added.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have discovered that corruption is bigger than the state and that the state is paralyzed by this (ruling) clique and cannot confront if or get rid of it,” Diab, who was a university professor at the American University of Beirut before he took the job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Although Diab’s resignation had appeared inevitable after the catastrophe, he seemed unwilling to leave and only two days ago made a televised speech in which he offered to stay on for two months to allow for various factions to agree on a roadmap for reforms. But the pressure from within his own Cabinet proved to be too much.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"1251f630-b900-11ea-eb8d-e9a507f1a8fe\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Diab’s government was formed after his predecessor, Saad Hariri, stepped down in October in response to the demonstrations. It took months of bickering among the leadership factions before they settled on Diab. \u003c/p>\u003cp>His government, which was supported by Hezbollah and its allies and seen as one-sided, was basically doomed from the start, tasked with meeting demands for reform but made up of all the factions that reformers want out. Now the process must start again, with Diab’s government in a caretaker role as the same factions debate a new one. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I hope that the caretaking period will not be long because the country cannot take that. Lets hope a new government will be formed quickly,” Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told reporters. “An effective government is the least we need to get out of this crisis.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The weekend protests saw clashes with security forces firing tear gas at protesters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The explosion is believed to have been caused by a fire that ignited a 2,750-ton stockpile of highly volatile ammonium nitrate. The material had been stored at the port since 2013 with few safeguards despite numerous warnings of the danger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The result was a disaster Lebanese blame squarely on their leadership’s corruption and neglect. Losses from the catastrophic blast are estimated to be between $10 billion to $15 billion, with nearly 300,000 people left homeless.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The last decision taken by Diab’s government before its resignation was to refer the case of the explosion to the Supreme Judicial Council, which handles crimes infringing on Lebanon’s national security as well as political and state security crimes. The Supreme Judicial Council is Lebanon’s top judicial body.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9216931994\">Full Coverage: Lebanon\u003c/div>\u003cp>A judge on Monday questioned the heads of the country’s security agencies. Public Prosecutor Ghassan El Khoury questioned Maj. Gen. Tony Saliba, the head of State Security, according to state-run National News Agency. It gave no further details, but other generals are scheduled to be questioned.\u003c/p>\u003cp>State Security had compiled a report about the dangers of storing the material at the port and sent a copy to the offices of the president and prime minister on July 20. The investigation is focused on how the ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the port and why nothing was done about it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Najjar, the public works minister, said he learned about the material’s presence 24 hours before the blast, receiving a report about the material and holding a meeting with port officials before calling its chief, Hassan Korayetem. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I wrote a report in the morning the explosion happened in the evening,” Najjar said. Asked why he only learned of it the day before, Najjar said, “I don’t know. Truly I don’t know.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 20 people have been detained after the blast, including the head of Lebanon’s customs department and his predecessor, as well as the head of the port. Dozens of people have been questioned, including two former Cabinet ministers, according to government officials. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Sunday, world leaders and international organizations pledged nearly $300 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Beirut, but warned that no money for rebuilding the capital would be made available until Lebanese authorities commit themselves to the political and economic reforms demanded by the people.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Iran, meanwhile, expressed concern that Western countries and their allies might exploit anger over the explosion to pursue their political interests. Iran supports the Hezbollah militant group, which along with its allies dominates the government and parliament.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said “it is natural for people to be frustrated.” But he said it would be “unacceptable if some individuals, groups and foreign countries use the incident as a pretext for their purposes and intentions.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz drew a line Monday between the blast and claims that Hezbollah stores its rockets and weapons deep inside civilian areas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While he did not accuse Hezbollah and its arms of being linked to the blast, Gantz said villages and towns across Lebanon were packed with Hezbollah arms that, if set off — whether by Israeli operations or by accident — would destroy homes.

A new leader, Meles Zenawi, was shaking off years of Marxist dictatorship and terrifying drought whose images of withered children left the world aghast. The former rebel had a vision that became his legacy, one of bringing millions of countrymen out of grinding poverty. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Amsale was newly arrived in the capital, Addis Ababa, from what is now neighboring Eritrea, her baby daughter in her arms. For her the child, Bethlehem Jafar, became a tiny symbol of the city’s rise.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bethlehem benefited from the welfare of the state and the charity of those who saw in her a better future. Her mother scraped by through manual labor, vowing her girl would never do the same.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fellow Ethiopians were moving up in the world, as the government looked to emulate China’s astonishing lifting of more than 800 million people from poverty. Some embraced new manufacturing jobs. Others left subsistence farms for the growing sectors of hospitality, services and aviation that catered to the changing times, hoping to join Africa’s expanding middle class.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"9b602274f3d3476a8252f8d13e7a709b\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The number of people in extreme poverty dropped dramatically, from nearly half of Ethiopia's population in the mid-1990s to 23% two decades later. “Impressive,” the World Bank said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The high-altitude city of Addis Ababa, Africa’s diplomatic capital, became an aviation hub, and a magnet for millions of citizens seeking better lives. Some grasped the first rung of upward mobility in the hustle of the untaxed informal sector, dodging the growing number of cars in the streets that signaled the middle class. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Under the country’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, the capital in the past two years has seen a wave of new construction, including malls and luxury apartments. And a source of national pride is a massive dam near completion on the Nile, funded completely by Ethiopia and its citizens in a bid to pull millions more from poverty. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now Ethiopians of all kinds are hurting in the pandemic. The country, along with Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, is expected to see half of sub-Saharan Africa’s new extreme poor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As the huge economic toll ahead became clearer, Ethiopia's prime minister took the global lead in appealing to rich countries to cancel the debt of poorer ones, saying his own country spends twice as much on paying off external debt as it does on health.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In trying to grasp the impact of a global slide into extreme poverty, even some experts feel at a loss. From his home in Addis Ababa, Fitsum Dagmawi has heard his countrymen's fear. As part of the World Bank survey, he is calling people across the country and asking how their lives have changed since the virus arrived.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We might interview five to 10 people a day, and this pandemic is affecting everyone,” he said. “We are feeling this stress every day.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some people begin weeping, recounting family member’s deaths, asking bewildered questions: What will we do now?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jobs are gone. Families wonder how to feed their children. The gatherings that played a stabilizing role — church services, weddings, funerals — have been limited or lost. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I will have to struggle,” one head of a household said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first round of calls to 3,200 households in Ethiopia found a 61% drop in employment, with many job losses in sectors closely tied to the country's growth: construction, hospitality, restaurants, big hotels. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The second round of calls saw some rebound, but employment could mean anything in a country where most work remains informal. Now some people with degrees find themselves seeking manual labor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Small shocks in income can have devastating effects,” World Bank senior economist Christina Wieser said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It shows. In Ethiopia, 55% of households blamed a drop in regular income for the inability to buy items like medicine or staple foods. Nearly 40% had lost all earnings from remittances from the large diaspora, a crucial way to stay afloat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For many Ethiopians, there is still little cushion between getting by and destitution. Just over 20% of households were relying on savings, and 19% were already eating less. A quarter had run out of food in the last 30 days, and just over 5% of households received support of any kind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have not paid my rent for two months, and I’m not sure my landlord will give me more time,” a 32-year-old father of two told the AP. “Just imagine, out of work and living with COVID. It’s very stressful.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was fired in May from a Chinese-owned company in one of the industrial parks that have sprung up in recent years as a government-backed engine of development.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were told business is slow due to the virus,” the man said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he hoped to be rehired. \u003c/p>\u003cp>So much depends on how long the pandemic lasts. The African Development Bank once assumed that COVID-19 would subside by June, country director Abdul Kamara said. Now, he said, “decades of poverty reduction in Ethiopia could be lost.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before the pandemic, the bank estimated the country’s economy would grow by more than 7% this year. The current worst-case scenario shows just 2.6%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ethiopia’s revenue losses are estimated at $1.2 billion, at a time when the government needs more money to expand social safety nets, Kamara said. And some 2.5 million jobs are threatened, roughly the same number of Ethiopians who enter the workforce every year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For a young woman like Bethlehem, the way forward seems in shambles. She was forced home from her studies as school closed and now shelters with her mother.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Their home is just steps away from a public toilet that overflows with the rainy season. “Even if we protect ourselves from infection, the area we are living in makes us vulnerable,’’ Amsale said. “And that worries us to death.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The better-off neighbors who once welcomed her into their homes to cook and clean now turn her away, fearing the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They told me we should avoid contact,” she said. “There was no help I received from them since.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She and her daughter make do with the equivalent of $34 a month that Amsale receives from local authorities for helping with projects like beautifying public spaces and sweeping the streets. But she doesn’t like to go out, fearing infection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bethlehem did not want to be photographed, anxious that images of her in the humble surroundings could further challenge her suddenly difficult future. She sat in their home, going over her books and lingering over a former teacher’s scribbled message of hope: “Bethi, we love you so much &amp; wish you success in your education.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her knowledge of public health makes her keenly aware how poverty compounds the risks of a deadly pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think Ethiopia’s peak (virus) season is yet to come, and I really hope some vaccines will be available soon,” Bethlehem said. “For now, we are waiting for a miracle that can change our lives.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Anna reported from Johannesburg.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP pandemic coverage at \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"Virus Outbreak-Extreme Poverty's Rise","headline":"Extreme poverty rises and a generation sees future slip away","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf","notificationId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf","videoContext":"hiopia, India, Nigeria, Congo and Bangladesh. \u003c/p>","embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By ELIAS MESERET and CARA ANNA","mediumIds":["0c34c8b251f94224b4cbc5e90068b177","9233dfd0b9854862ab22e2fa230024c4","e6d6c315b1cc486e983bf95cb244efcf","a40fa77fa1594770903765bb5779eccd","9416abed4a514922941295ef43ab7803","45c468f798f34c64bc4c9938037b5db8","9b602274f3d3476a8252f8d13e7a709b","37a0716d018c4bc19047028d924462cf"],"media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/0c34c8b251f94224b4cbc5e90068b177/","imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","externalId":null,"type":"Photo","imageRenderedSizes":[3000,2000,1000,800,600,400],"aspectRatio":1.5,"id":"0c34c8b251f94224b4cbc5e90068b177","videoRenderedSizes":[]}],"updated":"2020-08-10 13:48:11","mediaCount":8,"contentType":"text","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf","shortId":"727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf","firstWords":"\u003cp>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — As a domestic worker, Amsale Hailemariam knew from the inside out the luxury villas that had grown up around her simple shelter of raw metal and plastic sheeting.

His reelection chances imperiled by the pandemic, the Republican president contended his orders “will take care of pretty much this entire situation, as we know it.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='429b7922e4de4d53bc242dd583c82e2e' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>But the orders appeared to carry less weight than Trump promoted and cut federal relief spending by shifting more onto the shoulders of struggling states.

Democrats initially sought a $3.4 trillion package but said they lowered their demand to $2 trillion. Republicans had proposed a $1 trillion plan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump accused Democrats of trying to spend more than was needed and adding money for priorities unrelated to the pandemic. He said local aid amounted to “bailout money” for states and cities \"badly run by Democrats for many years. ... And we’re not willing to do that.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The president wants to continue paying a supplemental federal unemployment benefit for millions of Americans put out of work during the outbreak. But his order called for up to $400 payments each week, compared with \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/f3caeadfc8c7f88900470ac96820a36c\">the $600 that people had been receiving\u003c/a>. Trump said states would cover 25% of this money even as many are dealing with major budget shortfalls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As state officials questioned whether they could afford $100 per person per week, Trump offered a new angle to the plan. Speaking to reporters Sunday night as he returned to Washington, he said states could make application to have the federal government provide all or part of the $400 payments. He said decisions would be made on a state-by-state basis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump said earlier that the federal contribution would be redirected from disaster relief money at the Federal Emergency Management Agency — dollars not likely to last more than two months. Shifting FEMA disaster funds also would occur as the peak of hurricane season looms and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warns of an “extremely active” season already underway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, struggled during a television interview Sunday morning to clearly explain the specifics of his boss' order on unemployment aid. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the $100 share from states would come from from an earlier pool of federal money and that Trump may waive the requirement about how it can be used.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Look, that would cost us about $500 million between now and the end of the year,” said Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat. “I could take that money from testing. I don’t think that’s a great idea. I could take that money from, you know, mass disinfecting for our schools. I don’t think that’s a great idea.

His order on housing is not a guarantee against eviction, as he claimed, but instead directs the departments of the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development to identify money that could help those struggling to pay their monthly rent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump said the employee portion of the payroll tax would be deferred from Aug. 1 through the end of the year, and he raised the possibility of making it permanent, though experts said he lacked that authority. The temporary deferral would not directly aid unemployed workers, who do not pay the tax when they are jobless. Employees would need to repay the federal government eventually without an act of Congress.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president was silent on Saturday on how he would fund Medicare and Social Security benefits that the 7% tax on employee income covers. Democrats seized on the possible threat to Social Security as a signal that Trump wanted to cut the social safety net. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Sunday night, in the wake of that criticism, Trump told reporters the money would not come from Social Security but from the Treasury if the government didn't require workers to repay the taxes. Again, that would require congressional action.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If the Democrats want to challenge us in court and hold up unemployment benefits to those hardworking Americans who are out of a job because of COVID, they’re going to have a lot of explaining to do,” Mnuchin said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Both the White House and congressional Democrats indicated Sunday they wanted to resume negotiations, but no talks were scheduled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The breakdown comes with the Nov. 3 election approaching and the White House nervously watching signs that the economic recovery is slowing down as the coronavirus surges. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is not presidential leadership,\" Biden said. \"These orders are not real solutions. They are just another cynical ploy designed to deflect responsibility.

Many Republicans have expressed concern that a $600 weekly benefit, on top of existing state benefits, gives people an incentive to stay unemployed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But under Trump's plan, the $400 a week requires a state to commit to providing $100.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many states are already facing budget crunches caused by the pandemic. Asked at a news conference how many governors had signed on to participate, Trump answered: “If they don't, they don't. That's up to them.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump expressed a different view on Sunday night, following a day of state officials questioning how they could afford even $100 per person in additional weekly payments. He told reporters as he returned to Washington that states could make application to have the federal government provide all or part of the $400 payments. Decisions would be made state by state, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several state officials questioned how Trump’s initial proposal would work and often expressed doubt that they could afford to participate at the level Trump initially set without using federal funds.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Aubrey Layne, secretary of finance for Virginia Gov.

We will pay three-quarters, and the states will pay 25 percent.” In the same interview, though, he later said that “at a minimum, we will put in 300 bucks ... but I think all they (the states) have to do is put up an extra dollar, and we will be able to throw in the extra $100.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A clarifying statement from the White House said the “funds will be available for those who qualify by, among other things, receiving $100/week of existing assistance and certify that they have lost their jobs due to COVID-19.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several advocacy groups that follow the issue, though, said it's clear the way the executive order is structured that the federal money will be contingent on states making a 25 percent contribution.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, called the plan “an impossibility.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t know if the president is genuine in thinking the executive order is a resolution or if this is just a tactic in the negotiation,\" Cuomo said. \"But this is irreconcilable for the state. And I expect this is just a chapter in the book of Washington COVID mismanagement.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Connecticut, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said on CBS' “Face the Nation” that the plan would cost his state $500 million to provide that benefit for the rest of the year, and called Trump's plan “not a good idea.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I could take that money from testing — I don't think that's a good idea,” Lamont said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On CNN, Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine praised Trump for issuing the order.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He’s trying to do something. He’s trying to move the ball forward,” DeWine said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, he was noncommittal about whether Ohio would participate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re looking at it right now to see whether we can do this,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Maryland, Michael Ricci, spokesman for Republican Gov.

John Bel Edwards said “Right now we are reviewing the President’s order to determine exactly what the impact to the state would be.”\u003c/p>\u003cp> And in Michigan, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a press release that Trump “cut federal funding for unemployed workers and is requiring states that are facing severe holes in our budgets to provide 25% of the funding.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On ABC\"s “This Week,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it \"an unworkable plan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Most states will take months to implement it, because it’s brand new. It’s sort of put together with spit and paste. And many states, because they have to chip in $100, and they don’t have money, won’t do it,” Schumer said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many states struggled to adjust outdated computer systems to accommodate the $600 payment, which along with the massive influx of new claims resulted in long delays in providing benefits. Reprogramming the computers again to accommodate the new amount could result in similar glitches.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On ABC, Kudlow said that many of those outdated systems have since been upgraded.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t think there will be a huge delay.

There is a strong belief that after only a brief focus on Biden's running mate, the election would quickly return to being a referendum on Trump's presidency, which may be all the motivation Democrats need to drive massive turnout in November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet Biden risks a real backlash from his base if he doesn’t pick a woman of color, according to some activists. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It would be a reckless choice to pick a white running mate with a party that’s as dependent on black and brown voters as it is,” said Aimee Allison of She the People, a political advocacy network for women of color. “A Black woman as VP is a healing link that our country needs right now to navigate this historic moment.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Running mates are rarely a deciding factor in presidential elections. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kaine may have given Clinton a modest bump in his home state four years ago, but he did not prevent white men from abandoning Democrats in droves elsewhere. Republican nominee Mitt Romney picked Wisconsin native Paul Ryan in 2012 but lost Ryan’s home state by nearly 7 percentage points. Trump, a New York native, won Wisconsin four years later running alongside Mike Pence, who was an unpopular governor in Indiana.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some historians argue that adding Lyndon Johnson to the ticket helped John F. Kennedy win Texas in 1960 and capture the White House. \u003c/p>\u003cp>John McCain's 2008 selection of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin might be the most recent example of a running mate swaying an election. In that case, she had a negative impact when she appeared unfamiliar with world affairs and unprepared for the presidency. But those involved in the decision argue that larger forces were at work that year and that McCain's loss wasn't just because of Palin.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There was a lot of fury and chaos inside the campaign that resulted from it, but all of the electoral studies of voting behavior demonstrated there was really no electoral impact with (Palin) on the ticket,” said former McCain campaign adviser Steve Schmidt, who attributed McCain's loss to the collapse of the nation's economy and voters' desire for change after the George W. Bush presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In retrospect, it was obviously a terrible decision,\" Schmidt said of Palin, \"but people vote for the top of the ticket.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who was deeply involved in Ryan's vice presidential preparations in 2012, said the main objective of picking a running mate is to find someone who may complement the presidential nominee. But above all, the person should do no harm.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Trump campaign is eagerly awaiting Biden’s announcement and the attention it will almost certainly divert from \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/1b92ce21f8ddf7eefb634b92fee38fed\">the Republican president's struggle to control the coronavirus pandemic\u003c/a>, revive the economy and unify the nation. Given Biden’s advanced age, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh predicted that his pick would be far more significant than those of past nominees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Who he picks as VP could be seen as a sort of a living will for him politically,” Murtaugh said of Biden, who is three years older than Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He declined to offer any specific criticism of the finalists when asked. “It doesn’t matter to us who he picks,\" he said, \"because whoever it is will provide opportunities for us.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jaffe reported from Washington.

Others left subsistence farms for the growing sectors of hospitality, services and aviation that catered to the changing times, hoping to join Africa’s expanding middle class.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"9b602274f3d3476a8252f8d13e7a709b\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The number of people in extreme poverty dropped dramatically, from nearly half of Ethiopia's population in the mid-1990s to 23% two decades later. “Impressive,” the World Bank said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The high-altitude city of Addis Ababa, Africa’s diplomatic capital, became an aviation hub, and a magnet for millions of citizens seeking better lives. Some grasped the first rung of upward mobility in the hustle of the untaxed informal sector, dodging the growing number of cars in the streets that signaled the middle class. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Under the country’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, the capital in the past two years has seen a wave of new construction, including malls and luxury apartments. And a source of national pride is a massive dam near completion on the Nile, funded completely by Ethiopia and its citizens in a bid to pull millions more from poverty. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Now Ethiopians of all kinds are hurting in the pandemic. The country, along with Congo, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, is expected to see half of sub-Saharan Africa’s new extreme poor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As the huge economic toll ahead became clearer, Ethiopia's prime minister took the global lead in appealing to rich countries to cancel the debt of poorer ones, saying his own country spends twice as much on paying off external debt as it does on health.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In trying to grasp the impact of a global slide into extreme poverty, even some experts feel at a loss. From his home in Addis Ababa, Fitsum Dagmawi has heard his countrymen's fear. As part of the World Bank survey, he is calling people across the country and asking how their lives have changed since the virus arrived.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We might interview five to 10 people a day, and this pandemic is affecting everyone,” he said. “We are feeling this stress every day.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some people begin weeping, recounting family member’s deaths, asking bewildered questions: What will we do now?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jobs are gone. Families wonder how to feed their children. The gatherings that played a stabilizing role — church services, weddings, funerals — have been limited or lost. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I will have to struggle,” one head of a household said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first round of calls to 3,200 households in Ethiopia found a 61% drop in employment, with many job losses in sectors closely tied to the country's growth: construction, hospitality, restaurants, big hotels. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The second round of calls saw some rebound, but employment could mean anything in a country where most work remains informal. Now some people with degrees find themselves seeking manual labor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Small shocks in income can have devastating effects,” World Bank senior economist Christina Wieser said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It shows. In Ethiopia, 55% of households blamed a drop in regular income for the inability to buy items like medicine or staple foods. Nearly 40% had lost all earnings from remittances from the large diaspora, a crucial way to stay afloat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For many Ethiopians, there is still little cushion between getting by and destitution. Just over 20% of households were relying on savings, and 19% were already eating less. A quarter had run out of food in the last 30 days, and just over 5% of households received support of any kind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have not paid my rent for two months, and I’m not sure my landlord will give me more time,” a 32-year-old father of two told the AP. “Just imagine, out of work and living with COVID. It’s very stressful.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was fired in May from a Chinese-owned company in one of the industrial parks that have sprung up in recent years as a government-backed engine of development.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were told business is slow due to the virus,” the man said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he hoped to be rehired. \u003c/p>\u003cp>So much depends on how long the pandemic lasts. The African Development Bank once assumed that COVID-19 would subside by June, country director Abdul Kamara said. Now, he said, “decades of poverty reduction in Ethiopia could be lost.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before the pandemic, the bank estimated the country’s economy would grow by more than 7% this year. The current worst-case scenario shows just 2.6%. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ethiopia’s revenue losses are estimated at $1.2 billion, at a time when the government needs more money to expand social safety nets, Kamara said. And some 2.5 million jobs are threatened, roughly the same number of Ethiopians who enter the workforce every year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For a young woman like Bethlehem, the way forward seems in shambles. She was forced home from her studies as school closed and now shelters with her mother.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Their home is just steps away from a public toilet that overflows with the rainy season. “Even if we protect ourselves from infection, the area we are living in makes us vulnerable,’’ Amsale said. “And that worries us to death.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The better-off neighbors who once welcomed her into their homes to cook and clean now turn her away, fearing the virus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They told me we should avoid contact,” she said. “There was no help I received from them since.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>She and her daughter make do with the equivalent of $34 a month that Amsale receives from local authorities for helping with projects like beautifying public spaces and sweeping the streets. But she doesn’t like to go out, fearing infection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bethlehem did not want to be photographed, anxious that images of her in the humble surroundings could further challenge her suddenly difficult future. She sat in their home, going over her books and lingering over a former teacher’s scribbled message of hope: “Bethi, we love you so much &amp; wish you success in your education.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Her knowledge of public health makes her keenly aware how poverty compounds the risks of a deadly pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think Ethiopia’s peak (virus) season is yet to come, and I really hope some vaccines will be available soon,” Bethlehem said. “For now, we are waiting for a miracle that can change our lives.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Anna reported from Johannesburg.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP pandemic coverage at \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\">https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":"37a0716d018c4bc19047028d924462cf","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"727c2dea29daed6e226b964f8caadfcf_3a5aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — As a domestic worker, Amsale Hailemariam knew from the inside out the luxury villas that had grown up around her simple shelter of raw metal and plastic sheeting.

As a new school year approaches amid the coronavirus pandemic, she and her colleagues are threatening not to return unless it's repaired. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Her classroom has a window air conditioning unit, but she fears the stagnant air will increase the chances that an infected student could spread the virus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Window units just aren’t going to cut it. We don’t want to stay cool, we just want the air to flow properly,” said O’Connor, a science teacher who has worked at the Patria Mirabal School in Manhattan since 2009. “We are really super stressed out about it.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Schools around the country are facing similar problems as they plan or contemplate reopening this fall, dealing with aging air conditioning, heating and circulation systems that don’t work well or at all because maintenance and replacement were deferred due to tight budgets. Concerns about school infrastructure are adding momentum to plans in some districts, even in colder climates, to take classes outdoors for the sake of student and teacher health. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Nationwide, an estimated 41% of school districts need to update or replace their heating, ventilation and cooling systems in at least half their schools, according to a federal \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/0ea2072aa83cbf6957d66e4a8ab90287\">report \u003c/a> issued in June. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Education committee, called on the federal government to help districts improve their systems, saying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling ventilation an important part of coronavirus spread at schools. “Ventilation is key and you don’t fix that for free,″ Scott said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is no evidence that the disease can spread through ventilation systems from one classroom to the next, according to Dr. Edward Nardell, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in airborne diseases. The danger, Nardell said, is from ineffective systems that don’t remove floating viruses and let them linger in classrooms after they are expelled in an infected person’s breath, sneeze or cough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Most schools are designed for comfort, not for infection control. So there is a danger that if you put 20 kids in a room, that if one of them has asymptomatic COVID and is infectious, you now have 19 more kids who are exposed,” Nardell said. Healthy children almost always recover from COVID, if they become ill at all, but they can pass the disease to teachers, parents and other adults.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nardell believes schools should consider installing ultraviolet lights along classroom ceilings, a technology some used in the 1950s and earlier to combat measles, tuberculosis and other airborne diseases and that is still used in hospitals and homeless shelters. Viruses and bacteria are destroyed using a spectrum of UV light that is safe for humans. Manufacturers say the devices would cost $3,000 per classroom.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, say one solution to air circulation problems may be teaching classes outdoors, which was done during tuberculosis and influenza outbreaks in the early 1900s, even in cold weather. The coronavirus spreads less efficiently outdoors and students could more easily sit 6 feet (2 meters) apart.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Having classes outdoors has other benefits, said Sharon Danks, CEO of Green Schoolyards America, a Berkeley, California, nonprofit that advocates for outdoor education. Children actually are less distracted and feel better emotionally when taught outdoors, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Nature has been shown to restore the ability to pay attention,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Several schools in the Northeast have bought large event tents like those used at outdoor weddings and plan to use them to teach outside through November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The White River Valley Middle School in Bethel, Vermont, spent $50,000 on tents and another $20,000 on port-a-potties, hand-washing stations and other equipment. While some schools have equipped tents with propane heaters, White River Valley Principal Owen Bradley said his students can handle the expected November daytime temperatures in the 30s (about 0 Celsius) without them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bradley said one upside will be an opportunity to help students better understand and appreciate nature.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We hope they value it forever and help us save the planet,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schools bringing students back this fall will require or at least strongly suggest masks, but officials say they can only be so effective during six-hour school days indoors. Air circulation is needed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stephen Murley, the school superintendent in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said most of his district's 42 campuses have older air systems. When there is high humidity, they are set to recirculate drier indoor air to prevent unhealthy black mold from growing on the walls — but battling the coronavirus requires fresh air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have two things working at odds with each other,” Murley said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Janet Robinson, the superintendent in Stratford, Connecticut, said some of her district’s 13 schools were built between 80 and 100 years ago and aren't capable of handling modern air systems — “they are a challenge.” There are also crowding issues — one has classrooms built for 15 students but that typically have 25, making social distancing impossible.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is kind of naive for politicians and whoever to say, ‘Just bring (the students) in and keep them at 6 feet (2 meter) distance,‘” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brian Toth, superintendent of the Saint Marys Area School District in northern Pennsylvania, said his district’s five schools’ air systems have no exit vents to circulate fresh air in and the virus out. He estimates it would cost at least $600,000 per school to replace the systems. When his schools reopen Aug. 31, students will be asked to wear masks, but Pennsylvania law exempts children whose parents claim they have a physical or mental condition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You look at the way schools were built, nobody expected to have a classroom with a 6-foot radius around a student,” Toth said. Instead, classrooms “pack them in like sardines and now we are facing the consequences.”\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:9282728e7dac47d8809264e1fb9c0598","truncatedFirstWords":false,"etag":"9282728e7dac47d8809264e1fb9c0598_2a1aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"It has been seven years since the central air conditioning system worked at the New York City middle school where Lisa Fitzgerald O’Connor teaches.

If so, that would lead to a slower recovery in the job market than if restaurants, hotels, bars and retail shops were able to fully reopen and recall all their laid-off employees. Few expect that to happen.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>On Friday, economists expect the government to report that employers added 1.6 million jobs in July, according to data provider FactSet, and that the unemployment rate declined from 11.1% to a still-high 10.5%. At any other time, a million or more jobs would constitute an unheard-of increase. But July's expected gain would fall way short of June's 4.8 million increase and would signal that hiring has sharply slowed. It would also mean that the economy has regained barely 40% of the jobs that fell to the coronavirus.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"a7291d30-b900-11ea-800d-7979855c7ab2\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The pandemic has lasted far longer than most Americans expected, with likely profound consequences for the economy. Traditional retail stores will probably never regain their pre-pandemic levels of sales or employment as consumers increasingly turn to internet purchases. Online health care will likely eliminate some doctors' office jobs. And online videoconferencing will replace some portion of business travel. Those changes alone could destroy millions of jobs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Michelle Holder, a labor economist at John Jay College, said it's unlikely that many retail workers and others whose jobs are gone for good will find work this year, given that the viral outbreak will hold back hiring until a vaccine is widely available. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's definitely going to be a drag on the economy,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Steven Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago, estimates that even after the virus has been brought under control, the proportion of people working from home will triple compared with pre-pandemic levels. That could result in the shuttering of many restaurants, coffee shops and other downtown businesses. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The real estate data firm Zillow \u003ca href=\"https://www.zillowgroup.com/zillow-announces-indefinite-work-from-home-policy/\">said last week\u003c/a> that most of its 5,400 employees will now be allowed to work from home indefinitely. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“This recession is unusual in the extent of permanent (job) reallocation that will ultimately result,” Davis said. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9208461283\">Full Coverage: Economy\u003c/div>\u003cp>He and two co-authors \u003ca href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e2ea3a8097ed30c779bd707/t/5f1748b5671c822a8c7960e3/1595361462774/COVID+Reallocation+Shock%2C+20+July+2020.pdf\">have estimated\u003c/a> that up to 40% of layoffs in March through May were permanent. That figure will likely rise, he said, the longer the pandemic squeezes the economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re kind of past the stage where we’re quickly recalling workers to their old jobs,\" Davis said, “and getting to the stage that people will need to get new jobs at new companies or in new industries.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is a trend that points to a grinding, sluggish recovery. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Allegra Troiano initially thought her layoff in May from a company that provides English language instruction would last only through the summer and that she'd be recalled as the school year began. But as the months have gone by and with few school systems fully reopening, the company — ELS Language Centers — has made clear that's not the case. Just 10 of the 30 centers it operated before the pandemic have reopened, not including the one in Milwaukee, which Troiano managed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Troiano has tried to look for other jobs. But at 64 and with an autoimmune disease, she is reluctant to take work that would require public interaction. She also fears that her age makes a job hunt more difficult. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I am feeling that this is the end of my career,” she said. “The fortunate thing is I go on Medicare this January.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many other companies are giving up and closing their doors. Dunkin' Donuts said last week that it will close 800 stores this year, about 8% of its total. Lord &amp; Taylor, America's oldest retailer, and the parent company of Men's Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/984a698bba16652723b1c9ec7bc22e82\">both said Monday\u003c/a> that they would file for bankruptcy protection. Last month, Brooks Brothers, another men's chain deeply hurt by the decline in formal business clothes, sought bankruptcy protection. \u003c/p>\u003cp>One-third of bars and lounges have permanently closed nationwide, up from about one-quarter in late June, according to the small business data analysis firm Womply. So have one-fifth of restaurants and 12% of retailers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Partnership for New York City, a business group, \u003ca href=\"https://pfnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/actionandcollaboration.pdf\"> projects that\u003c/a> one-third of the city's small businesses will close for good. In California, mass layoff notices filed with the state now show that about half the job cuts are permanent, up from 17% in May. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/ba6ea32e7a5ee4b79c7aed945e4d25b7\"> a survey by\u003c/a> The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research in July found that nearly half of those who have lost jobs during the pandemic say those jobs are gone for good. By contrast, in April, 78% had thought their layoffs would prove only temporary. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Business shutdowns have fallen disproportionately on Black-owned businesses, which are more than twice as likely to close as white-owned small companies, according to a report from the \u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/DoubleJeopardy_COVID19andBlackOwnedBusinesses\">New York Federal Reserve\u003c/a>.

Hiring has slowed much more in states with heavy viral outbreaks, including Arizona, Florida, and Texas, they said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official who is president of the nonprofit WorkingNation, said that widespread school closings this fall could also depress job gains in future months because some parents will have to quit jobs to watch their children. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I worry about what that means for women, who are most often in that role,\" Oates said. “That’s going to be disruptive.\"\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:89992979ca3c3ba72eb2cd31a9ca0e5d","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"89992979ca3c3ba72eb2cd31a9ca0e5d_0a9aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Stark evidence of the damage the resurgent viral outbreak has caused the U.S. economy could come Friday when the government is expected to report that the pace of hiring has...","version":null,"latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:89992979ca3c3ba72eb2cd31a9ca0e5d","revision":null,"mediumIds":["22b1c5fa78d3408581887c1472ef78f8"],"media":[{"alignment":null,"audioMimeType":null,"altText":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"type":"Photo","flattenedCaption":"FILE - People wait to speak with representatives from the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission about unemployment claims Thursday, July 9, 2020, in Midwest City, Okla.

If 2020 had to be condensed into a single word — and there are many, many words to describe it — uncertainty would hover at the top of the list. Uncertainty about health. About the future. About the country itself. And uncertainty about livelihoods and jobs and economic security in a historical moment where each day seems to bring a fresh wave of unwanted developments. \u003c/p>\u003cp>America has faced economic calamity before, most recently during the recession of 2008, when the jobless rate soared to 10%. That pales in comparison to the two crises that have cost more than 160,000 American lives and ushered in spiraling unemployment — 30 million job losses, of which 17.5 million people remain unemployed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s not just the scope of the losses,” says Martha Gimbel, an economist at Schmidt Futures. “Until we have solved the public health crisis or have a timeline ... none of us is going to know what’s going on.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uncertainty, painted onto the landscape by the numbers.

The comfort of living with his parents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saigh was eager to start over after being laid off in 2019 from a Detroit-area marketing company. After a half-year of searching for work, Saigh decided it would be cheaper to continue his quest from home. He moved in with his parents in Iron River, in Michigan’ s Upper Peninsula. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A few months later, Saigh was hired to lead a nonprofit attached to his local hospital. He’d be working 5 miles from home, reuniting with friends in Iron River, population 3,000 — and doing something positive for his community.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was just perfect,\" he says. \"It was like, “Wow! Everything is falling in place.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Then the pandemic swooped in. Hospitals faced new financial pressures. The offer was rescinded. Saigh went from dream job to no job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It was back to sending out resumes, checking LinkedIn, canvassing for interviews during one of the most brutal job markets in decades. “It can be overwhelming at times just to go through this again,” he says.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"5cdead759248456e80029d3cafe1d7b0\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He considers himself lucky, avoiding rent and other expenses living with his parents.

He’s adjusted to an economy where so much remains unknown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’ve learned that you can’t possibly plan for everything and, though it’s a cliche, you’ve just got to roll with the punches,” he says. “And I’ve learned to go where the next thing leads me.

His employer, the Diplomat Beach resort in Hollywood, Florida, closed in March because of the outbreak. That left Jackson, an assistant to the bartender and server at a hotel restaurant, and his wife, an elementary school teacher, scrambling to provide for their three asthmatic children.\u003c/p>\u003cp>They’ve tried to shield them from money troubles. “It’s not their job to go out and make things happen,” Jackson says. “As a parent, you don’t want to give kids the perception that the ground is crumbling under your feet.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Complicating the situation is Florida’s unemployment system, which has been marred by computer glitches and lengthy delays. Despite countless calls over the months, Jackson, 51, says he has yet to receive a single $275 weekly state unemployment check — even though his last day of work was March 21. That cap is among the stingiest in the nation.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"391e638e1ddb42b1a34e83d5d7812621\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The stress has frayed his nerves. His doctor, who waived copayments for visits, prescribed medicine for his high blood pressure, but he can’t afford it. His hair is thinning. He gets migraines.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jackson and his wife have traditionally depended on help from her teaching salary, but she’s been off during the summer. With $3,200 in monthly bills, the two regularly face tough choices. “If you do have money,” he says, “do you spend it on gas or do you get food?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jackson is hoping to find a warehouse job for now. He worries about having enough food for his kids — 8 to 18 — and being able to afford school supplies, clothes and everything else they'll need in coming months.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He refuses to look too far ahead. “This is a day-to-day process,” he says, “and I can’t worry about the things I cannot change.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>BRETT LIPSHUTZ\u003c/p>\u003cp>He can’t help but think he was a victim of bad timing. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last year, after tiring of being an educator, he gave up a job teaching French in a private school in suburban Milwaukee. He was recruited to become a bilingual software trainer, traveling to Canada three weeks a month. In the spring, he rushed back to the U.S. as the border was about to close.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then suddenly, at 46, Lipshutz was out of work — something entirely new for him. He filed for unemployment and joined a support group of jobless workers in Wisconsin. He began figuring out how much to dip into savings that had taken years to amass. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Not having enough money can paralyze you,” he says. It’s a lesson he learned at a young age.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I grew up with a single mom on welfare in the ’80s,” Lipshutz says. “And I know what it’s like to collect government cheese and free lunch and to live paycheck to paycheck and feel that stress of financial instability. .... It brings back trauma from that time of, ‘Oh, my God, am I going to have to live like that again?’\"\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"e9c0fd71fecf4afa82e77547156f8817\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Lipshutz’s second software project was canceled because of budget cuts. He’s now starting a tofu business with friends.

I can’t control the job market.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"In the back of my mind,” he adds, “there’s still a tiny drawer of anxiety and worry. ...

A diabetic, Githmark, 24, has an increased chance of becoming seriously ill if she contracts the coronavirus. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I feel like I don’t have very much of a purpose now,” she says. She feels as if she’s “floating around in life” as she searches for work, with her father helping retool her resume. She knows her job possibilities are limited because she can’t be exposed to large groups of people.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Githmark plans to enroll in grad school, though she hasn’t chosen a field of study. She taught in a charter school in Durham, North Carolina, before moving into marketing. She may return to education. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, gardening and writing help relieve the tension. “It’s just been a very stressful time,” she says, and sighs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>MICAH ANDERSON\u003c/p>\u003cp>When the Portland, Oregon, club where he tended bar was forced to close in the pandemic's early days, he had no time to plan how he’d pay his bills. But he knew some routine expenses would have to wait.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the top of the list were $250 monthly payments he’d been making for more than a decade to whittle down $45,000 in student loans. There was no way he could shoulder that. His immediate worries were food and shelter, and he was pleasantly surprised when he was given some leeway in paying rent and utilities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For the past six months, Anderson, 37, has relied on state unemployment and $600-a-week pandemic-related federal benefits that just expired. In Washington, Democrats and Republicans are clashing over how much of that aid should continue and for how long.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Anderson has been cautious about spending. He walks almost everywhere. He has reduced his food budget to essentials. He doesn't go out with friends. He’s become politically active, calling the offices of federal lawmakers, urging them to back a bill creating a $120 billion fund to help rescue restaurants and bars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And as stressful days give way to sleepless nights, he and his friends commiserate over their shared predicament.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’ve got kind of overwhelming sense of dread,” he says, echoing the sentiments of a friend who said being caught in the pandemic is “like standing on the shore and you’re looking at this huge tsunami wave coming in. and you know it’s going to hit. But there’s not a whole lot I can really do about it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>DEANNA KOUSKOULAS \u003c/p>\u003cp>She isn’t one to point fingers. She knows many others who’ve looked at the staggering numbers of unemployed and don’t feel the same way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I see a lot of people blaming companies, saying, ‘How dare they lay off their employees!’” she says. “But those decisions have to be made.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kouskoulas, 30, was laid off in April, about six months after being hired for a copywriting-marketing job at a suburban Detroit construction company. \u003c/p>\u003cp>She’s now interviewing for jobs, preparing for the post-pandemic era. She spends part of every morning sharpening and expanding her skills, studying graphic design on YouTube, among other things, “so I can come out strong when things do go back to normal.” And she speaks regularly with a CEO she once worked for who acts as her mentor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Shortly after Kouskoulas lost her job, she thought she had a lucky break: She was hired to do marketing at a software firm. She worked 60-hour weeks, she says, but was repeatedly rebuffed when she asked for a paycheck. After four weeks, she’d had enough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In recent weeks, Kouskoulas says she senses the “quietness in the economy” that existed a few month ago has lifted and there are more opportunities. But she also worries some employers will be consolidating roles, producing fewer jobs with more responsibilities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She’s prepared, too, for what she expects will be “a long haul.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“At the end of the day,” she says, \"the only person who’s going to get me out of this is me.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uncertainty ripples outward. There are so many things that, because of it, simply can't be done.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It spreads to those who’ve permanently lost jobs as well as furloughed workers wondering if they’ll be called back. “People may tell you to retrain,” says Gimbel, the economist. “What are you supposed to retrain for? You don’t know what the economy is going to look like. Everyone is frozen because it’s so unclear how the situation is going to evolve.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And long-term planning? Even murkier — impossible, really, says Adam Ozimek, chief economist at Upwork.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We don’t know whether at the end of the year there are going to be 15 million people without a job or 5 million people,” he says. \"From top to bottom, every single person in the economy is affected by this uncertainty in one way or another.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Job uncertainty is new for Flint, 53, the travel agent. She's never been unemployed, and it's “doubly scary,” she says, because she's single. Her furlough is up at the end of October, but there’s no guarantee she won’t be laid off before then. Every week, she sends out fresh resumes from her home in Galveston, Texas. And every day, she fends off scam artists who call with bogus job offers as they try to ferret out her private information.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I've had anxiety that I’ve never had before. I’ve even had panic attacks. I’ve had crazy dreams of zombies,” she says. \"It has worn on me.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>For Micah Anderson, the uncertainty has been the hardest part — “having zero idea of what next week is going to even look like.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m the type of person who, if I if I have an idea of what I’m facing, I can try to make a plan that makes sense,” Anderson says. “But you don’t really know what it is you need to do.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You just have no clue.

She felt fortunate to no longer be among the roughly 30 million Americans who remain jobless and are now struggling with suddenly reduced unemployment aid.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet the return of her job hardly ended Huddleston's financial troubles. Her employer, its revenue shrunken by the loss of customers, cut her schedule to four days a week. That meant a $300 drop in monthly pay — money that, along with overtime, had allowed Huddleston to afford rent, a car payment and other necessities. Now, she'll have to decide what to stop paying when she runs through her savings. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I go from day to day,” said Huddleston, 59. “I handle it better some days than others.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Huddleston belongs to a category of Americans who are largely overlooked at a time when unemployment is high and a critically important $600-a-week federal jobless benefit has just expired: People who still have jobs but whose financial struggles have nevertheless escalated in the face of the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some have endured pay cuts or have had their hours slashed. Others have been furloughed temporarily — without pay. Many just feel seized by fear that their job could vanish at any time or that their struggling employer will go out of business. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They are caught in the grip of a pandemic that has \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/c1878e580f5acd2c0305e5236c4e3197\">pummeled the economy, \u003c/a> forcing lockdowns that closed businesses and leaving many people too worried about infection to travel, shop, gather in crowds or eat out — or barred from doing so by states or localities. Yet their predicaments, as much as the wave of layoffs the virus triggered, speak to the dire impact the virus has had on the American labor force. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They don't portend good things for the economy, said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, who notes that anxious consumers, whether they hold a job or not, typically cut back on spending, the primary driver of the economy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The insecurity of what has happened to people around them may lead people to save as much as possible,\" she said. “And that could decrease spending in the sense that, ‘I don’t know what happens next.’ ” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Consider Ellen Boudreau, a 59-year-old bookkeeper in Manchester, New Hampshire. She’s become a self-described “miser” since her work hours were reduced after a six-week layoff and her husband, David, a lab technician, had his schedule cut to four days for several months — and then was furloughed every other week in July.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Her husband wants a new television to replace a projection model at their home. Boudreau, though, has pushed back. She's worried, in part, about other expenses, including the possibility of a costly trip to the veterinarian for their 15-year-old Shih Tzu.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He really wants the TV,” she said. “Normally, I wouldn’t have thought about it. We don’t have the security anymore of a job.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Atlanta, Sirnorris Mitchell was forced to dip into his savings to pay for diabetes medication after his work hours, too, were reduced. Mitchell had been trying to re-establish his independence with the help of Homes of Light, a homeless services organization connected to United Way. Then the coronavirus eliminated his part-time office job. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Having initially worked full time with a home-and-office cleaning company this spring, Mitchell, 50, now barely gets even a few hours a week. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When all this junk took off and they started closing businesses down and I couldn’t find work like I wanted to, it put a big impact on me,” he said. “And then when you got diabetes and stuff, it’s hard to deal with everything at once.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The financial pressures of the still-employed come against the backdrop of a catastrophic toll of layoffs. The number of laid-off Americans who have applied for unemployment benefits has topped 1 million for \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/f3caeadfc8c7f88900470ac96820a36c\">20 straight weeks\u003c/a>. All told, roughly 30 million people are out of work, the government says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Friday, the government said the economy \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e0aca194f0f4870b01280049ca567a87\">added 1.8 million jobs in July\u003c/a>, a pullback from the previous two months' gains and evidence that the resurgent coronavirus is weakening hiring and any economic rebound. The hiring of the past three months has regained barely more than 40% of the jobs lost to the pandemic-induced recession. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The number of Americans who have endured wage cuts or reductions in work hours isn't as definitive. But federal data, combined with economic research, puts the figure at around 11 million. In July, more than 7 million Americans reported that they were working part time because their hours had been cut — far more than the 2.8 million who said so in February — the government said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And from March through June, businesses reduced the pay of an additional 6.8 million workers, economists at the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve estimated in a study that relied on data from payroll processor ADP. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Overall, about half of Americans in \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/ba6ea32e7a5ee4b79c7aed945e4d25b7\">a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research \u003c/a> released in July say they or someone in their household has lost some income since the pandemic struck. That includes 27% who say someone has been laid off, 33% who report someone has endured a reduction in hours, 24% who say someone has taken unpaid time off and 29% who say someone had wages or salaries reduced.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Typically during recessions, employers have avoided cutting pay for fear of further worsening morale. The pay cuts during this downturn underscore the depth of the economic toll.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gould, the EPI economist, noted that worker pay had risen meaningfully in the couple of years before the pandemic struck as demand for labor rose in a growing economy. Any gains in bargaining power, though, have likely been lost.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Workers that have their job now are like, ‘I’m going to hold onto this job,' \" she said. \" 'I’m not going to do anything to rock the boat. I’m not going to ask for a raise. I’m not going to talk about any hardships.’ ”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the meantime, anxiety about job security has reached a higher pitch for some. Since being furloughed in March and then recalled to work, Steve Ward, a mattress salesman at Macy’s flagship store in Manhattan, has seen three of his colleagues let go. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ward, who has worked at Macy’s for 35 years, fears that his job could be next because the pandemic has shrunk the number of customers in his department by roughly half.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I worry about myself, the future,\" said Ward, 58, who had hoped to retire at 65. “In the back of my mind, I do think about what retail will look like. What’s going to happen to Macy’s? This is not going away unless there is a cure.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Shelbyville, Indiana, Huddleston's reduced hours have forced her to become even thriftier. A labor union, UNITE HERE!, helped pay her $734 monthly rent when she was out of work. To meet her expenses now, she dips into the unemployment aid she had received during her furlough. A food pantry helps with groceries. She tucks away half a sandwich or other leftovers from lunch provided by the casino and often eats macaroni and cheese.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet she worries that it won't be enough to keep her solvent indefinitely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just pray to God that he helps me through it,\" she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Writer Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, and AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:9f9bad06017aec634488f5ab6b38dbae","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"9f9bad06017aec634488f5ab6b38dbae_0a37aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"ATLANTA (AP) — Getting her job back should have been a relief for Leesa Huddleston.\n\nA kitchen worker at an Indiana casino, Huddleston returned in June after a three-month furlough caused by...","version":null,"latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:9f9bad06017aec634488f5ab6b38dbae","revision":null,"mediumIds":["c86a7ceab76a4f3bb578f7b63801e570","24349f9818f04f25a78fa2952932229b","8e09261fef0c4735bdd1884d4e6c5825","eb03632c9054493091f67d2693dc1f84","b2497ddca8c2410e9848987deb5aa69c","25ffbc3f0f2d4d648260c0bc22f807a3","558231ca5dba485881f2971d96ce7b29","31dc9e36448c4724aedc91ac77d624a2","d53149a61fce45a1a4bdaf46fd034f46"],"media":[{"alignment":null,"audioMimeType":null,"altText":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"type":"Photo","flattenedCaption":"Leesa Huddleston talks about washing dishes and cleaning kitchens at a casino from her home, Monday, Aug. 3, 2020, in Shelbyville, Ind.

lost $1.8B in 2Q as riders stayed home and ordered in","storyHTML":"\u003cp>NEW YORK (AP) — Uber lost $1.78 billion in the second quarter as the pandemic carved a gaping hole in its ride-hailing business, with millions of people staying home to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's pinning its hopes in part on its booming food-delivery business, but that bustling corner of the company didn't turn a profit.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The San Francisco-based ride-hailing giant brought in $2.24 billion in revenue during the second quarter, down 27% from the same time last year, on a constant currency basis, the company said Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uber’s mobility business, which includes ride-hailing and micro-mobility options such as scooters and bikes, saw its revenue shrink to $790 million, down 67% from $2.38 billion a year ago.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“While we would have all hoped that by now we had a clear line of sight to the end of the pandemic, hope is not a strategy and it’s my job to ensure that Uber is well prepared for any scenario,” CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a conference call with investors Thursday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uber's Eats delivery business — once just a fraction of the company — brought in $1.21 billion in revenue during the quarter. That was up 103% from $595 million in last year's second quarter.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As some people stay closer to home, more people are ordering from Uber Eats than ever before, Khosrowshahi said.\u003c/p>\u003cp> “The COVID crisis has moved delivery from a luxury to a utility,” he added.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gross bookings for Uber’s mobility business plummeted 73% from the same quarter last year. Its delivery business grew 113% on a constant currency basis, but did not turn a profit, instead losing about $232 million during the quarter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The businesses that are interfacing with the public are bleeding out, and it’s a concerning time for investors that are involved,” said Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Patriarch Organization private equity firm. “You’ve got to innovate. You’ve got to do what Uber is trying to do, which is to look for other paths.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uber's quarterly losses included $382 million in restructuring and related charges as the company laid off 6,700 people — a quarter of its workforce — in May. Uber said at the time that it would be closing or consolidating 45 offices worldwide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uber revenue fell in the U.S. and in across the world except in the Asia-Pacific region. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The biggest enemy to Uber is rationality,” Schiffer said, referring to people who don’t want to ride in a shared vehicle during a pandemic. “They’re rational and they have empathy and compassion. They don’t want to become super-spreaders. They also have loved ones as well as responsibility to the community.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Uber said it still expects to become profitable — when adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — sometime in 2021. But with its core rides business so brutally hit by the pandemic, some are skeptical.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m pessimistic. I wonder if they’ll ever really make a profit,” said Daniel Morgan, vice president at Synovus Trust Company. “They have no way of bringing their costs down ... they have to pay the drivers.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And those costs could rise. In addition to struggling with reduced demand for rides during the pandemic, Uber has been hit with lawsuits challenging the way it treats its drivers. California's Labor Commissioner Lilia Garcia-Brower filed complaints against Uber and Lyft Wednesday saying the companies committed wage theft by misclassifying employees as independent contractors. The suit seeks to recover civil penalties and unpaid overtime and minimum wage. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“This was important not only for the workers, but also for responsible employers who are undercut when companies do not pay their fair share on taxes, worker’s comp, and wages,” Garcia-Brower said in an interview. “During this time of the pandemic, it has highlighted the damage that misclassification does to our safety net.”\u003c/p>","dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:0f8e3abcb75223850aecb2147150d4a9","truncatedFirstWords":true,"etag":"0f8e3abcb75223850aecb2147150d4a9_3a7aza0c0","flattenedFirstWords":"NEW YORK (AP) — Uber lost $1.78 billion in the second quarter as the pandemic carved a gaping hole in its ride-hailing business, with millions of people staying home to reduce the spread of the...","version":null,"latestEtag":null,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:0f8e3abcb75223850aecb2147150d4a9","revision":null,"mediumIds":["5726f7178382432691cb6452dd4c54aa"],"media":[{"alignment":null,"audioMimeType":null,"altText":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"type":"Photo","flattenedCaption":"FILE - This Aug. 9, 2019 file photo, the logo for Uber appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

Concerns about school infrastructure are adding momentum to plans in some districts, even in colder climates, to take classes outdoors for the sake of student and teacher health. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Nationwide, an estimated 41% of school districts need to update or replace their heating, ventilation and cooling systems in at least half their schools, according to a federal \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/0ea2072aa83cbf6957d66e4a8ab90287\">report \u003c/a> issued in June. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chairman of the House Education committee, called on the federal government to help districts improve their systems, saying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calling ventilation an important part of coronavirus spread at schools. “Ventilation is key and you don’t fix that for free,″ Scott said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is no evidence that the disease can spread through ventilation systems from one classroom to the next, according to Dr. Edward Nardell, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in airborne diseases. The danger, Nardell said, is from ineffective systems that don’t remove floating viruses and let them linger in classrooms after they are expelled in an infected person’s breath, sneeze or cough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Most schools are designed for comfort, not for infection control. So there is a danger that if you put 20 kids in a room, that if one of them has asymptomatic COVID and is infectious, you now have 19 more kids who are exposed,” Nardell said. Healthy children almost always recover from COVID, if they become ill at all, but they can pass the disease to teachers, parents and other adults.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nardell believes schools should consider installing ultraviolet lights along classroom ceilings, a technology some used in the 1950s and earlier to combat measles, tuberculosis and other airborne diseases and that is still used in hospitals and homeless shelters. Viruses and bacteria are destroyed using a spectrum of UV light that is safe for humans. Manufacturers say the devices would cost $3,000 per classroom.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Some, including Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, say one solution to air circulation problems may be teaching classes outdoors, which was done during tuberculosis and influenza outbreaks in the early 1900s, even in cold weather. The coronavirus spreads less efficiently outdoors and students could more easily sit 6 feet (2 meters) apart.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Having classes outdoors has other benefits, said Sharon Danks, CEO of Green Schoolyards America, a Berkeley, California, nonprofit that advocates for outdoor education. Children actually are less distracted and feel better emotionally when taught outdoors, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Nature has been shown to restore the ability to pay attention,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Several schools in the Northeast have bought large event tents like those used at outdoor weddings and plan to use them to teach outside through November.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The White River Valley Middle School in Bethel, Vermont, spent $50,000 on tents and another $20,000 on port-a-potties, hand-washing stations and other equipment. While some schools have equipped tents with propane heaters, White River Valley Principal Owen Bradley said his students can handle the expected November daytime temperatures in the 30s (about 0 Celsius) without them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bradley said one upside will be an opportunity to help students better understand and appreciate nature.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We hope they value it forever and help us save the planet,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Schools bringing students back this fall will require or at least strongly suggest masks, but officials say they can only be so effective during six-hour school days indoors. Air circulation is needed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stephen Murley, the school superintendent in Green Bay, Wisconsin, said most of his district's 42 campuses have older air systems. When there is high humidity, they are set to recirculate drier indoor air to prevent unhealthy black mold from growing on the walls — but battling the coronavirus requires fresh air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have two things working at odds with each other,” Murley said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Janet Robinson, the superintendent in Stratford, Connecticut, said some of her district’s 13 schools were built between 80 and 100 years ago and aren't capable of handling modern air systems — “they are a challenge.” There are also crowding issues — one has classrooms built for 15 students but that typically have 25, making social distancing impossible.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It is kind of naive for politicians and whoever to say, ‘Just bring (the students) in and keep them at 6 feet (2 meter) distance,‘” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Brian Toth, superintendent of the Saint Marys Area School District in northern Pennsylvania, said his district’s five schools’ air systems have no exit vents to circulate fresh air in and the virus out. He estimates it would cost at least $600,000 per school to replace the systems. When his schools reopen Aug. 31, students will be asked to wear masks, but Pennsylvania law exempts children whose parents claim they have a physical or mental condition.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You look at the way schools were built, nobody expected to have a classroom with a 6-foot radius around a student,” Toth said.

The investigation is focused on how the ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the port and why nothing was done about it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Najjar, the public works minister, said he learned about the material’s presence 24 hours before the blast, receiving a report about the material and holding a meeting with port officials before calling its chief, Hassan Korayetem. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I wrote a report in the morning the explosion happened in the evening,” Najjar said.

Rights activists said one person died after being run over by a police truck — which the authorities denied. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Election officials said Monday that Lukashenko won a sixth term in office with 80% of the vote, while opposition challenger Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya got 10%. Tsikhanouskaya dismissed the official results as a sham and submitted a formal request for a recount to the Central Election Commission. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Monday evening, scattered groups of opposition supporters began gathering in downtown Minsk, chanting “Freedom!” and “Long live Belarus!.” Heavy police contingents deployed to block central squares and avenues.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The brutal police crackdown drew harsh criticism from European capitals and will likely complicate Lukashenko’s efforts to mend ties with the West amid tensions with his main ally and sponsor, Russia.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Lukashenko, whose iron-fisted rule since 1994 has fueled growing discontent in the ex-Soviet nation of 9.5 million, warned that he wouldn’t hesitate to use force again to disperse the opposition demonstrations. He argued that the protesters met a due response overnight after injuring 25 police officers and attempting to take control of official buildings in several Belarusian cities.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We will not allow them to tear the country apart,\" he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The 65-year-old former state farm director asserted that the opposition was being directed from Poland and the Czech Republic, adding that some groups in Ukraine and Russia could also have been behind the protests. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They are directing the (opposition) headquarters where those sheep don't understand what they want from them,” he said in a dismissive reference to Tsikhanouskaya and her campaign.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek dismissed Lukashenko's claim, saying his country has not organized any protests.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Interior Ministry said 89 people were injured during the protests, including 39 law enforcement officers, and about 3,000 people were detained, some 1,000 of them in Minsk. It insisted that no one was killed during the protests and called reports about a fatality “an absolute fake.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tsikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old former English teacher without any prior political experience, entered the race after her husband, an opposition blogger who had hoped to run for president, was arrested in May.

The post-election protest, in which young demonstrators — many of them teenagers — confronted police, marked a previously unseen level of violence. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Internet and mobile networks went down after the polls closed as authorities tried to make it more difficult for protesters to coordinate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The more they beat us, the less we believe in the official results,” said Denis Golubev, a 28-year-old IT specialist who joined the protests. “They cut the internet and blocked communications to shut our mouths, but it won't stop the protests.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The European Union condemned the police crackdown and called for an immediate release of all those detained.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In a joint statement, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and the EU commissioner responsible for relations with Europe’s close neighbors, Oliver Varhelyi, lamented that “the election night was marred with disproportionate and unacceptable state violence against peaceful protesters.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Belarusian authorities must ensure that the fundamental right of peaceful assembly is respected,” they said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Belarus' EU and NATO neighbors, Poland and Lithuania, also issued strong rebukes.

In early February, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo became the first U.S. chief diplomat in more than 25 years to travel to Belarus, and offered to sell U.S. oil and gas to the country to reduce its dependence on Russian energy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The administration has also nominated career diplomat Julie Fisher as ambassador to Belarus. If confirmed by Senate, she would be the first U.S. envoy to the country since 2008. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Fisher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at her confirmation hearing last week that her task would be “to re-establish the bilateral relationship and to support Belarus’ efforts to protect its sovereignty and independence in the face of political pressure aimed at undermining both.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Throughout his tenure, Lukashenko has tried to exert pressure on the Kremlin with the prospect of normalizing ties with the West in a bid to win more Russian subsidies. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The violent crackdown now appears certain to derail Lukashenko's hopes for closer ties with the West, even as he tries to resist what he describes as Russia's attempts to encroach on Belarus' independence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Moscow this year cut supplies of cheap oil to Belarusian refineries, depriving the country of an estimated $700 million in revenues from oil product exports to the West. Russia-Belarus ties were further strained last week, when Belarusian law enforcement agencies arrested 33 Russian private military contractors and accused them of planning to stage “mass riots.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Moscow has rejected the charges. Russian President Vladimir Putin called Lukashenko Friday to mend the rift, and quickly congratulated him Monday on winning the vote. The Belarusian leader also received congratulations from Chinese President Xi Jinping and heads of several ex-Soviet nations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Analysts warn that even though Lukashenko can easily suppress the opposition protests, he will face mounting challenges ahead.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Lukashenko's victory will bring him no relief, it will only exacerbate both domestic and external problems of Belarus that will snowball,” said Artyom Shraibman, an independent political analyst based in Minsk.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press journalists Jim Heintz, Vladimir Isachenkov and Daria Litvinova in Moscow, Lorne Cook in Brussels, Matthew Lee in Washington, Danica Kirka in London, Vanessa Gera in Warsaw, Frank Jordans in Berlin and Karel Janicek in Prague contributed to this story.\u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"EU--Belarus-Election","headline":"Belarus' ruler quashes opposition protest after vote","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:9a9a4324a3c6a913ac6cc0abaedcc342","notificationId":null,"videoContext":"the data of the central election commission.\" \u003c/p>","embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By YURAS KARMANAU","mediumIds":["ad02c44e31eb43b493523fc989388414","2ef521dde5044b1eb0c55639c0253524","9678f2eb88de45db8ad8620247b25574","7315c989bef04d01b03ad01ede30cf0e","fbff4b0782924a2996035a2557afcbb7","937651282e1743a8a1b77eabe13d16bf","aeadfcfabe29421f8f9184f0b97fdb93","d0c85a373e584d91aa3d8d843b216f3a","70cc865e7c9f43a088b38740e2949d94","747b78f70b354eec964300745bf9dbb7","f219caf3bcd14cdaa99ee7cdc666f6d6","5bd057285f3f43b0ba330c1fb4c4bd5b","a096238fc71c4d459eacb0f4c9525fdf","783e4a272c2e41fc93b7410b990c8008","485e686d04054dfbbed2fd6546f33b85","21cba80d5fb4485fa22cb310ebca2340","3a23e2734c3646c58a49ecc6cff55b27","cdc6913181a648bd9ce7dbca0f4a8149","585f4468adb042d196cb048d23f33102","0a3786547b914e46bd88c615db4c40c9","d4eb6b916c8c45358f57d4d7c9f83d8e","203f12d345314c5daa7fed3f6618be18","e60e571e6e734507bcff4b79eb6167d8","b623c04847294d7397650615ec5afa9d","f4221a6f9ecb4bc784029746fd1c2ef4","91780be8adc24d8a9b788bf54a250173","67a461dfca78445f99b00cd2755219e4","0f2d1a61f1114b378a3e29214702b215"],"media":[],"updated":"2020-08-10 17:03:37","mediaCount":28,"contentType":"text","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:9a9a4324a3c6a913ac6cc0abaedcc342","shortId":"9a9a4324a3c6a913ac6cc0abaedcc342","firstWords":"\u003cp>MINSK, Belarus (AP) — Belarus’ authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko warned Monday that the protesters who challenge the official vote results extending his 26-year rule will face a tough...\u003c/p>","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"layoutType":"Small Photo","hasTextOverlay":false,"tagIds":["AlexanderLukashenko","Belarus","apf-intlnews","apf-Europe","SviatlanaTsikhanouskaya","Elections","apf-topnews","VirusOutbreak","apf-europe","Minsk"],"language":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[],"published":"2020-08-10 07:19:13","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/9a9a4324a3c6a913ac6cc0abaedcc342","leadPhotoId":"ad02c44e31eb43b493523fc989388414"}],"localMemberName":null,"pollId":null,"notificationUrl":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"pollFilters":{},"sponsorServeAd":false,"teamLimit":null,"shortId":"9a9a4324a3c6a913ac6cc0abaedcc342","layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"textColor":null,"disclaimerText":null,"notificationText":null,"allowAd":true,"cardType":"Wire Story","teams":[],"sponsorUrl":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null},{"feed":[],"bracketsSettings":null,"pollUpdated":null,"textScale":null,"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekTagId":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hubPeekTagName":null,"cardHeadline":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:2a7da92b56a9874e801e2bad931686e2","hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"contents":[{"embedHTML":null,"leadVideoId":null,"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"downloadSettings":null,"tagObjs":[{"name":"College football","isPr":null,"order":0,"canonicalName":"college-football","id":"Collegefootball"},{"name":"Health","isPr":null,"order":0,"canonicalName":"health","id":"apf-Health"},{"name":"Field hockey","isPr":null,"order":0,"canonicalName":"field-hockey","id":"Fieldhockey"},{"name":"Football","isPr":null,"order":0,"canonicalName":"football","id":"Football"},{"name":"Sports -

His $35 million salary, which is entirely deferred, was sliced to $12.96 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>MLB’s initial proposal in late May would have cut the highest-paid stars the most, and Scherzer’s 2020 salary would have been reduced to about $4.85 million.

It's the first trading since Trump signed executive orders over the weekend to extend an expired benefit for unemployed workers, among other things.

Like other businesses that depend on people feeling safe enough to travel, MGM Resorts has been pummeled by the pandemic, and its shares more than halved in March alone. Barry Diller, IAC’s chairman, called it a “once in a decade” opportunity, citing its potential to move business online. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But losses for technology stocks were weighing on the market. It's a continuation of their struggles from Friday, when worries rose that worsening U.S.-China relations could mean retaliations against the U.S. tech industry.

Critics had already been calling tech stocks overpriced, even after accounting for their huge and resilient profits. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If stocks end the day higher, it would extend the S&amp;P 500’s wining streak to seven days, which would be its longest since the spring of 2019. The rally had carried the S&amp;P 500 all the way back to within 1% of its record, which was set before the pandemic pancaked the economy into recession. It had been down nearly 34% in March.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Investors have been saying the economy needs another big lifeline from Washington, and quickly, after $600 in weekly unemployment benefits for workers from the federal government expired with July's end. But talks broke apart on Friday, and Trump issued his executive orders on Saturday. Both the White House and congressional Democrats indicated Sunday they wanted to resume negotiations, but no talks were scheduled.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Almost immediately after Trump signed the orders, critics said the moves did not go far enough to support the economy and questioned how they would work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The economy has shown some signs of improvement since the spring but it is still struggling.

The power of Tony Finau, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Champ was on full display.

He made the \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PGAChampionship/status/1292617604314603521\">eagle putt\u003c/a> and was on his way to a two-shot victory with a 6-under 64, matching the lowest final round by a PGA champion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were no spectators because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Casey must have felt like one. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/016dd03d35f0165653c0fafb9fb2106b\">He was still on the 17th tee\u003c/a> when he looked back and saw Morikawa's shot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Nothing you can do but tip your cap to that,” Casey said. “Collin has taken on that challenge and pulled it off. That's what champions do.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>He won at Muirfield Village last month not from that bold play on the 14th hole, but after Justin Thomas made a 50-foot birdie putt in the playoff. Morikawa answered with a 25-foot birdie of his own and won two holes later.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He is comfortable in the most uncomfortable situations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was Thomas who gave Morikawa more confidence than he needed. They got together for dinner at the Canadian Open last summer, Morikawa's first start since graduating from Cal. Thomas told him he was good enough, he would make it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Thomas knew from experience. He spent a year in the minor leagues before getting his PGA Tour card, went through a year of learning without winning and now has 13 wins, a major and twice has been No. 1 in the world.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Morikawa didn't wait that long. He won the Barracuda Championship to earn a PGA Tour card. He won against a strong field for validation. Now he's a major champion.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Young stars are emerging every year, and it was easy to overlook Morikawa. He was a runner-up two years in a row for the Hogan Award, given to the nation's best college player. Doug Ghim won in 2018, Matthew Wolff a year later. And it was Wolff who denied Morikawa a victory last year in Minnesota by making a long eagle putt on the last hole.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Players know best.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s always a bunch of guys that rock up on the scene, and he didn’t necessarily get the most publicity out of the group he was in,” Casey said. “I know talent when I see it. I don't like the term ‘talent,’ but you know when somebody is good. And Collin was good. We could just tell. ... And we weren't wrong.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Morikawa grew up in Southern California with Wolff. He considers the Bay Area a second home from his time at Cal and the dozen times the Golden Bears played or had qualifiers at Harding Park, a public course that never was this tough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In just over a year — it feels less than that because of the three months golf was shut down because of the pandemic — he has emerged as a star without ever being surprised.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He thought back to his debut 14 months ago and recalled being comfortable then. He tied for 14th.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There's a different sense of comfort now,” Morikawa said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another big smile.

While the absence of pictures and real names makes it more difficult to mentally and emotionally connect with the two main characters, Goudeau rises to the reporting and writing challenge, showing how seemingly ordinary tasks such as struggling to operate a shower control amplifies loneliness and the loss of everything the refugees once knew.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More importantly, the book raises issues of refugee resettlement that the United States never truly has resolved. We like to think of ourselves as welcoming in the manner symbolized by the Statue of Liberty but the reality is many of our citizens would rather Mu Naw and Hasna stayed home. For them and other would-be refugees tortured or killed in their countries, we offer a collective national shrug – it’s unfortunate but not of consuming interest to Americans bickering these days among ourselves about everything.\u003c/p>\u003cp>We weren’t always that way.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 1948, the United States agree to accept 400,000 refugees from Europe who were among the 10 million displaced by World War II.

As Goudeau notes, the number of refugees worldwide now is almost 71 million.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To Goudeau that number is an atrocity, a stain on our national conscience. Her book may not change national policy implemented by a president reflexively opposed to welcoming refugees, but in bringing the stories of Mu Naw and Hasna to us, the author shows that welcoming them doesn’t just save their lives and their children’s, but that their contribution to the American story ultimately enriches us all.\u003c/p>","embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Book Review-After The Last Border","headline":"Review: American culture seen new in 'After the Last Border'","localMemberName":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:4ef9db05e0a7abf0b997c1abfdd78c59","notificationId":null,"videoContext":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"By JEFF ROWE","mediumIds":["23aa294ddd6e47fcb05e997730be4619"],"media":[],"updated":"2020-08-10 14:57:22","mediaCount":1,"contentType":"text","gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:4ef9db05e0a7abf0b997c1abfdd78c59","shortId":"4ef9db05e0a7abf0b997c1abfdd78c59","firstWords":"\u003cp>“After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America,\" by Jessica Goudeau, (Viking) \u003c/p>\u003cp>In this book we take a journey into American culture through the eyes of Mu Naw from...\u003c/p>","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"layoutType":"Small Photo","hasTextOverlay":false,"tagIds":["BookReviews","apf-entertainment","Immigration"],"language":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"published":"2020-08-10 14:57:19","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/4ef9db05e0a7abf0b997c1abfdd78c59","leadPhotoId":"23aa294ddd6e47fcb05e997730be4619"}],"localMemberName":null,"pollId":null,"notificationUrl":null,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"pollFilters":{},"sponsorServeAd":false,"teamLimit":null,"shortId":"4ef9db05e0a7abf0b997c1abfdd78c59","layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"textColor":null,"disclaimerText":null,"notificationText":null,"allowAd":true,"cardType":"Wire Story","teams":[],"sponsorUrl":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"sponsorAttribution":null},{"feed":[],"bracketsSettings":null,"pollUpdated":null,"textScale":null,"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","tagObjs":[],"hubPeekTagName":null,"cardHeadline":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:42cb919592a81a4b02f6e2ea30831eb2","hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"contents":[{"embedHTML":null,"leadVideoId":null,"embedHeight":null,"contentSponsor":null,"downloadSettings":null,"tagObjs":[{"name":"U.S. News","isPr":null,"order":7,"canonicalName":"u-s-news","id":"apf-usnews"},{"name":"AP Top News","isPr":null,"order":7,"canonicalName":"ap-top-news","id":"apf-topnews"},{"name":"Baltimore","isPr":null,"order":0,"canonicalName":"baltimore","id":"Baltimore"},{"name":"Explosions","isPr":null,"order":0,"canonicalName":"explosions","id":"Explosions"}],"storyHTML":"\u003cp>BALTIMORE (AP) — A natural gas explosion destroyed three row houses in Baltimore on Monday, killing a woman and trapping other people in the wreckage.

Now some people with degrees find themselves seeking manual labor.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Small shocks in income can have devastating effects,” World Bank senior economist Christina Wieser said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It shows. In Ethiopia, 55% of households blamed a drop in regular income for the inability to buy items like medicine or staple foods. Nearly 40% had lost all earnings from remittances from the large diaspora, a crucial way to stay afloat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For many Ethiopians, there is still little cushion between getting by and destitution. Just over 20% of households were relying on savings, and 19% were already eating less. A quarter had run out of food in the last 30 days, and just over 5% of households received support of any kind.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I have not paid my rent for two months, and I’m not sure my landlord will give me more time,” a 32-year-old father of two told the AP. “Just imagine, out of work and living with COVID.

The African Development Bank once assumed that COVID-19 would subside by June, country director Abdul Kamara said. Now, he said, “decades of poverty reduction in Ethiopia could be lost.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before the pandemic, the bank estimated the country’s economy would grow by more than 7% this year.

I might order a Swiss cheese and bacon burger, or one topped with blue cheese and caramelized onions, and that, I thought, was where the flavor was.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then I realized I could make my own burger blend with better quality cuts of beef. This changed the way I make and eat burgers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When I am making my own blend, I choose bits of short rib, brisket, hanger steak and ribeye. All the rich cuts. Add a bit of aged beef too, and you get a swoon-worthy, slightly funky, slightly nutty aroma and flavor. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Today, you can buy these specialty burger blends already made and conveniently packaged in 1-pound “bricks” or pre-made burgers. When you are shopping, follow the advice of meat scientist Diana Clark from Certified Angus Beef: For a thick, gourmet-like burger, look for a blend of 80 percent lean, 20 percent fat. “The extra fat is going to melt and make a juicy, tasty burger.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>There are many butchers who sell burger blends online and at grocery stores. My favorites include \u003ca href=\"https://shop.lafrieda.com\">Pat LaFrieda\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://shop.schweidandsons.com/collections/all\">Schweid and Sons\u003c/a>. I have purchased the pre-made burgers, but I prefer the bricks because I can make my signature square burgers from them easily.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The meat is vacuum-sealed, which means it is as close to fresh as you can buy without grinding it yourself. With vacuum-sealed meat, the oxygen is almost eliminated, so the rate of deterioration is much slower. Fresh meat wrapped in brown butcher paper will last a maximum of three days refrigerated, while vacuum-sealed meat will last up to 2 weeks in the refrigerator and much longer in a freezer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To make square burgers from the bricks, carefully remove the meat from the packaging and, using a fine serrated knife, cut it into four equal, quarter-pound shares. I round the sharp edges of each square in my hands, as I would soften a lump of clay, being careful not to make it too round. I want to keep the thick square shape. After it is smooth and even, I make a depression in the center so the burger will cook evenly and not puff up like a meatball. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Because you are buying premium ground beef blends, you don’t need to add anything to make it taste great. A generous sprinkle of fresh-ground black pepper and coarse kosher salt is all you need. My ratio is 1 teaspoon Morton Kosher salt to 1/3 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Mix the salt and pepper together and season both sides of the burger.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>I like to place my burgers on the grill for about 3-4 minutes per side for a thick patty like this one. You will get great grill marks, and the middle will still be medium-rare to medium. If you buy the pre-made patties, cook them a little less because they are not as thick as my homemade square burgers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>If you don’t have a grill, or you run out of gas, these are equally good made in a cast-iron pan. Preheat the pan on your stovetop over medium-high heat, and the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Don’t put anything in the pan — no butter, no oil. Once it is hot enough for a drop of water to dance across the surface, place the four patties on the hot cast-iron skillet and let cook for 2 minutes or until the burgers develop a good crust. Flip them and let cook on the stovetop for 2 more minutes. Then place the skillet with burgers in the pre-heated oven for 5 minutes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>If you're making cheeseburgers, add the cheese during the last 2 minutes of cooking. Remove the burgers to a platter and let them rest for five minutes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In this stripped-down version of my current favorite burger, less is more. A good blend eliminates the need for most traditional condiments, but if you crave them, use them. For me, the perfect bite is a dill pickle chip, melty American cheese and the hot crusty burger between a potato bun.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>EDITOR’S NOTE: Elizabeth Karmel is a grilling, barbecue and Southern foods expert, and the author of four cookbooks.

The Panthers were eliminated from the playoffs on Friday, falling to the New York Islanders in four games.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That ouster, the end of yet another season of high expectations that didn’t deliver as planned, sealed Tallon’s fate.

We have not seen our efforts come to fruition. We will now begin an organizational search for the next General Manager.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Panthers' decision to seek a new GM came one day after the NHL first-round playoff matchups were set, and hours before the league was holding the second phase of its draft lottery — with Florida being one of the eight teams with an equal shot at the No. 1 overall pick and chance to draft prized winger Alexis Lafreniere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I would like to thank the South Florida fans and community for the last 10 years, and the Viola family for the last seven with this franchise,” Tallon said. “I have had the opportunity to work with a group of first-class individuals, including a mentor of mine, the late William A. Torrey and I’ve had the privilege of watching the development of the organization’s young talent who have become great players and even better people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s believed that the Panthers will look outside the organization for a new GM. Senior vice president of hockey operations and assistant general manager Eric Joyce will likely continue to oversee the team’s AHL club.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And Roberto Luongo, the longtime Panthers goalie whose jersey was retired by the club earlier this year, is expected to remain with Florida. Luongo was brought on this season as a special advisor to Tallon, but is not believed to be a GM candidate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tallon had been with Florida since May 17, 2010, coming in at a time when the Panthers were 10 years removed from what had been their most recent playoff appearance.

He brought Luongo back to Florida in a trade, swung a deal in 2015 that added Jaromir Jagr to the club, assembled the 2015-16 that set team records for wins (47) and points (103), and last year was instrumental in the talks that lured his close friend Joel Quenneville to take over as coach of the Panthers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Oddly, history is repeating itself on that front.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tallon, then in Chicago, hired Quenneville to coach the Blackhawks in 2008 and wound up watching him win three Stanley Cups there in a six-year span.

World Health Assembly.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Such moves have increased already considerable bipartisan sympathy for Taipei in Washington and prompted new measures to strengthen governmental and military

Bush presidency.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In retrospect, it was obviously a terrible decision,\" Schmidt said of Palin, \"but people vote for the top of the ticket.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican who was deeply involved in Ryan's vice presidential preparations in 2012, said the main objective of picking a running mate is to find someone who may complement the presidential nominee.

Biden is under intense pressure to do just that this week, although it may not be accurate to assume he's already ruled out the white women. He met privately with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who's white, last week. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who also is white, has also been a leading contender.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, it would be a surprise if Biden did not choose a Black woman from a short list that includes at least three prominent African Americans: California Sen. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/d3fc8b88cde56bac9f1e7b5e494fb019\">Kamala Harris\u003c/a>, former national security adviser \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/a039b1438447d18e01d7fde247c666e7\">Susan Rice\u003c/a> and California Rep. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/fd2466e6990775bf961ac332b1cc02ea\">Karen Bass\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's worth noting here that running mates have rarely, if ever, swayed a presidential election in the modern era.

Both groups are opposed to Trump, but that doesn't mean they're necessarily excited to turn out for Biden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It's fair to wonder how effective the leading candidates would be in exciting the Democratic base. Harris struggled to energize Black voters behind \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/9f15f9bae46c54de8d88ad3e8388e4be\">her primary campaign\u003c/a> earlier in the year, and Rice and Bass remain largely unknown nationally.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Will anyone stop Russia? \u003c/p>\u003cp>They warned us that Russia would be back, and now U.S. intelligence officials have confirmed that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/e98a8285f773403af163bc720d70fc2d\">Russia is using a variety of measures to denigrate Biden\u003c/a> ahead of the November election and that individuals linked to the Kremlin are boosting Trump’s reelection bid. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The country’s counterintelligence chief, William Evanina, on Friday offered the most specific warning to date about the threat of foreign interference in the 2020 election. He also announced that U.S. officials believe that China does not want Trump to win a second term and has accelerated its criticism of the White House.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the assessment presents a much more direct threat from Russia, which, of course, has been charged by the U.S. government for various crimes related to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/48f9d5132d7a4e2d823edad8fc407979\">interfering in the 2016 election\u003c/a> on Trump's behalf.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Trump administration implemented a series of sanctions in recent years against Russia, but it's unclear if the president will do anything else to confront the new threat of foreign interference. He again appeared to dispute his own government's intelligence over the weekend when asked about Evanina's warning. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump because nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have — ever,” Trump said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, Trump's Republican allies on Capitol Hill are waging an ongoing probe into \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/9d4595ba4f3140c6bb6a3473a91f4a4c\">Biden's son Hunter\u003c/a> and his work in Ukraine that parallels Russian disinformation efforts. The statement released Friday called out by name a pro-Russia Ukrainian lawmaker who has been spreading unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Biden and his son, which make up the core of the Republican investigation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Will Trump's executive actions make an impact? \u003c/p>\u003cp>With Congress gridlocked and the nation in crisis, Trump over the weekend \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/96a1c20494cc9ebb547a44aa60406168\">bypassed the legislative branch with executive actions\u003c/a> that deferred payroll taxes and offered a supplemental federal unemployment benefit of up to $400 a week to millions of Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It may not be legal. But it's easy to see out-of-work Americans warming to Trump's move given that a week earlier an estimated 30 million people lost enhanced unemployment benefits in the midst of a public health crisis because of congressional inaction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump's willingness to make his own rules has often gotten him into trouble over the last four years. And it may again this time. But Congress' inability to get a deal done in the midst of legitimate crises is a reminder why voters supported a populist outsider in the first place. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>THE FINAL THOUGHT\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is likely more risk than reward waiting for Biden as he weighs whether to pick a woman of color to serve as his running mate.

But it's far from certain that a Black female vice presidential nominee would on its own produce the kind of strong African American turnout Democrats need to defeat Trump. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Given the expectations, however, Biden faces a real backlash should he not pick a woman of color.
